# Changelog


All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Alongside the standard sections, a "Breaking" section marks changes
that require operator action; these are surfaced at the top of stable
release notes.

## [2.94.1] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- Switches were squashed on phones. A control with a width class is still a
  flex item, so a long label beside one steals its width once the row stops
  fitting: at 360px a switch next to a two-line label lost a third of its
  width. The row only overflows on narrow screens, which is why every desktop
  review passed it. The switch now holds its size, and the design guide
  records the rule for every fixed-size control in a flex row.
- The queue pager wrapped onto two lines on a phone. It now stays on one,
  showing first, current, and last below the small breakpoint.
- Import, Export, and the community sync stamp on the Ad Patterns header were
  three different sizes. They share one recipe now, and the stamp shows a date
  instead of a full timestamp that wrapped to three lines.
- The play button on a detection table row was 33px against 30px neighbours.
  Both come from one shared recipe now, as the card and marker rows already
  did.
- Saving on a detection whose category resolves to keep returned a 409. The
  modal offered Save and Not an ad on a marker the corrections endpoint will
  always refuse; it now shows the category picker as the way through and says
  so.

### Added

- Set a detection's category from the Ad Review and Detected Ads rows, and a
  pattern's category from the Ad Patterns table, without opening the editor.
  Review is bulk work, and the category is what decides whether a span is cut.

## [2.94.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Rate-limit queue hold. When the LLM provider answers 429 with a reset
  more than five minutes out, the episode waits and the queue pauses until
  the reset instead of burning retries on a throttled provider. Shorter
  resets keep the existing in-process retry, so a lone throttled window
  still recovers. Detection, review, and verification are all covered: a
  throttle arriving mid-run defers the episode rather than skipping that
  stage. Off by default, with a give-up window of 1-720 hours (default 48),
  under Settings > AI & Processing > Queue Control. Play and Reprocess run
  even mid-pause, and turning the toggle off lifts the pause and releases
  held episodes. A held episode never inherits the clock of an earlier
  offline deferral.
- Per-episode priority control in the Processing Queue panel. Each waiting
  row gets a priority field with -/+ buttons, backed by
  `POST /feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episodeId}/queue-priority`. Send `priority`
  for an exact value or `delta` to nudge the stored one; a delta is added
  server-side, so a click made against a stale list value still lands.
  Either can lower a priority, unlike re-enqueueing; a feed-level queue
  priority change still restamps the row.
- The Processing Queue waiting list is paginated at 25 rows per page, so
  nothing hides behind a "+N further back in the queue" note.
  `GET /episodes/processing` takes offset and limit (default 200, cap
  1000), and positions stay correct across pages.
- Queue Control, a new section in AI & Processing. It groups the queue
  priority boosts (moved out of Global Defaults), the process-new-episodes
  toggle, the offline queue (moved out of Data & Security), and the
  rate-limit hold.
- Transcript Normalization is now its own section in AI & Processing, with
  help text explaining that the rules correct Whisper output for words,
  phrases, numbers, sponsor names, and URLs. The Sponsors page drops its
  Normalizations tab.
- A detected ad's category can be changed from the Detected ad window. The
  category decides whether a span is cut, beeped, or left in, so this is how
  you cut one the feed is currently keeping. It changes that episode's marker
  only; a linked pattern keeps its own category, edited in the pattern detail
  modal.
- Review decisions no longer re-cut an episode one at a time. Confirming,
  rejecting, or recategorizing records the decision and marks the episode,
  and an Apply recuts button on the Ad Review and Detected Ads pages cuts
  every waiting episode once. An episode edited five times is rebuilt once
  instead of five times. An episode that no longer has its original audio
  keeps its decisions, and the button says how many it could not recut.
- Opt-in JSON schema response format for OpenAI-compatible providers (#693,
  #694). Detection, review, category repair, and trim recovery send a
  json_schema response_format once the toggle in the LLM Provider section
  is on. Support is probed and remembered per model rather than per
  endpoint, because one URL can serve models that differ on it; a model
  that does not support it falls back to json_object at request build or on
  a runtime 400 instead of losing the format hint. Anthropic call sites are
  unchanged.

### Fixed

- A full or LLM-mode reprocess no longer wipes the episode's transcript and
  ad markers up front (#692). The clear now happens in the transcribe
  stage, immediately before the fresh transcript is saved, so an OOM kill
  or container restart mid-run leaves the prior results intact instead of
  emptying the episode.
- The ad reviewer's system prompt examples now show the same shape the
  reviewer actually sends (#695): candidate markers, and a [start-end]
  stamp on every line including the 60 seconds of context on each side.
  The model can now read a trim boundary off a context line instead of
  interpolating one. Installs still on the shipped default get the
  corrected examples on upgrade; customized prompts are left alone.
- fpcalc fingerprinting survives recoverable decode hiccups (#690). All
  three fingerprint call sites parse stdout before honoring the exit code,
  so an episode with one bad frame no longer loses all cue scanning.
- A detected ad whose category resolves to keep no longer shows Confirm and
  Not-an-ad buttons that the API always refused with a 409. The row says the
  span is left in because of its category and offers Edit, which is where
  the category can now be changed.
- Correction failures show what the server actually said instead of a fixed
  "Try again", which sent you in circles on a refusal that would never
  succeed.
- The offline queue's "waiting" count included only LLM deferrals, so a
  Whisper outage read as zero episodes waiting. It now counts every
  deferral it owns.
- A single model rejecting plain JSON mode no longer downgrades every other
  model on the same OpenAI-compatible endpoint to prompt injection, across
  restarts. Both response-format answers are now remembered per model.
- The play button on ad review cards, detected-ads rows, and the episode
  page's held and rejected marker rows matches the height of the buttons
  beside it at every breakpoint, instead of sitting short on mobile.
- The settings toggle is slimmer, matching the switch spec now written down
  in the design guide.
- 3- and 4-digit queue positions no longer paint over the episode title on
  mobile. The position column is wider, and the row stacks its controls
  below the title on narrow screens.
- The cue-template create endpoint's docstring no longer claims to accept a
  required `label` (#691); the display label comes from cueType, so the LLM
  prompt always sees a fixed phrase.

## [2.93.3] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Unprocessed local episodes are playable in the admin UI: the episode page
  gets a player for the retained original, captioned so you know ad removal
  has not run yet.
- When an import leaves errored or skipped entries behind, the bulk import
  section offers "Rescan staged files" and "Add files to staged set", so a
  bad sidecar can be fixed and rescanned without re-uploading the audio.

### Fixed

- Each new file selection in bulk import replaces the staged set instead of
  piling on top of earlier attempts, so the preview always shows what you
  just picked.
- The post-commit staging sweep keeps files that belong to errored or
  skipped entries instead of deleting them with the junk.
- The upload response carries the episode's artwork URL instead of null.
- Description fields start six rows tall instead of three.
- Progress text in the import panel is announced to screen readers.

## [2.93.2] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- Import status and the one-import-per-feed guard now work across gunicorn
  workers: job state lives in a file with a per-feed lock, so polling no
  longer flips to idle or returns another session's report, and two commits
  can't race the same staging files. A worker crash mid-import surfaces as
  "import interrupted" instead of running forever.
- The original-audio route, the ad editor, and now the episode detail page
  itself all reach a local episode's retained original (the original-file
  marker was never set on import or upload). The detail page now plays it
  directly for any local episode that hasn't finished a processing run,
  instead of leaving the operator with nothing to preview.
- One out-of-order date pair no longer stamps its error on every clean file
  in a batch; the pair carries the error and the plan reports it once as a
  batch-level problem that blocks the commit.
- Overwrite re-imports of an episode first imported under a wide id (like
  s01e0006) now replace that episode instead of creating a duplicate, and
  the choice of which row to reset is deterministic.
- Import commits consume sidecar files along with the audio, from the
  import directory as well as staging. A finished staging import now sweeps
  only what it committed or rejected outright; a skipped or errored entry's
  own audio and sidecars stay staged, so fixing the problem (usually a bad
  sidecar) doesn't mean re-uploading a good mp3. Directory-source commits
  never touch staging, uploads are refused while an import is running, and
  deleting the feed clears its import state files.
- Single uploads: untitled episodes get an "Episode N" title instead of an
  empty tag, embedded cover art is extracted like the import path does, and
  episode artwork shows up in the episode JSON.
- Episode edits reject unknown fields instead of silently ignoring typos;
  the overwrite-mismatch error names the actual cause; enclosures carry a
  length attribute; the import panel's Cancel no longer deletes staged
  files. Staging is now cleared automatically at the start of each new
  file selection instead, so one pick of files never piles onto another.

## [2.93.1] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Local episodes play immediately: an episode that has not been processed
  yet serves its retained original right away, with range support, while
  ad removal waits its turn in the queue. Before this, podcast apps got
  a 503 until the queue freed up, which made a fresh archive unlistenable
  behind a long backlog.
- Bulk import UI: per-file upload progress ("Uploading 3 of 12"), an
  overwrite toggle ("Replace episodes that already exist") wired to the
  scan and commit, an accurate replace count on the commit button, and a
  dismissible import report. The panel now also names the server import
  directory path, and the docs cover docker-compose mounts for it,
  including one parent folder holding a subfolder per feed.
- Podcasting 2.0 editors for funding, person, license, location, txt,
  and podroll in the feed panel, so everything the API accepts is
  editable in the UI.

### Fixed

- Episode buttons say "Process" instead of "Reprocess" when an episode
  has never been processed.
- A reprocess window no longer serves the ad-laden original for an
  episode that already has a processed file on disk.
- Bulk uploads no longer trip the global API rate limit, and a rejected
  file list survives a failed scan.

## [2.93.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Local feeds: build a podcast feed from your own audio files, with no
  upstream RSS behind it. `POST /api/v1/feeds` with `feedType: "local"`
  creates one; episodes go in via single upload or bulk archive import
  (a strict `sNNeNN` naming scheme, optional JSON sidecar metadata, a
  dry-run preview before anything is written, and synthesized publish
  dates when none is given). Every episode runs through the same
  ad-removal, transcript, and chapter pipeline as a subscribed feed's.
  Podcasting 2.0 channel and episode metadata (funding, person, license,
  location, txt, podroll, medium, locked, locked owner) is editable per
  feed, through the API or the feed's panel in the UI. Local feeds are
  fully exempt from retention and cleanup, since their audio is the only
  copy.
  See [docs/local-feeds.md](docs/local-feeds.md).

## [2.92.1] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Queue boost sizes are settings under Settings > Global Defaults > Queue
  priority: play-or-reprocess (default 20), new-episode (default 5), and
  Reprocess All (default 0). `queueManualBoost`, `queueFreshBoost`, and
  `queueBulkBoost` on `PUT /api/v1/settings`.

### Fixed

- A play request or manual reprocess now always outranks backlog work.
  Reprocess All and segment re-renders no longer stamp every episode with
  the full manual boost, which once pinned a just-published episode 94th
  behind a 93-episode two-year-old backfill for an estimated two days. A
  queued episode's priority can now rise but never fall, so playing an
  episode that is already queued lifts it to the front instead of the
  boost being silently discarded.

## [2.92.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- Per-feed retention override on the feed settings page. A feed can follow
  the global retention window, keep its episodes for its own number of
  days, or archive so nothing is ever deleted. Archive is meant for shows
  that stopped publishing, where a swept episode cannot be fetched again.
  An archived feed is also skipped by the "Clear all processed audio"
  action, which otherwise overrides retention: a per-feed 0 is a deliberate
  "never delete this show", while a feed inheriting a globally disabled
  retention is still wiped. `retentionDaysOverride` on
  `PATCH /api/v1/feeds/{slug}`.
- Per-feed override for keeping the pre-cut original audio, with the same
  inherit / on / off shape as the global toggle. Archived feeds keep their
  originals too, so this is how to archive a show without paying for the
  uncut copies. Applies from the next episode processed and does not delete
  originals already on disk. `keepOriginalAudioOverride` on
  `PATCH /api/v1/feeds/{slug}`.
- AI Models settings fields can switch to free text for model IDs the
  provider catalog does not list, such as proxies, private deployments, and
  newly released models. Adapted from @d-portero's fork.
- Processing History shows the reason a run failed under the episode title,
  truncated with the full text on hover. Adapted from @d-portero's fork.
- The addressing-mode Stats card now tracks ad yield per mode alongside
  contract compliance: ads proposed, ads kept, and drops split by reason.
  Invalid segment-id references are counted, which is the signal the
  segment-ID experiment exists to measure. Yield is recorded from this
  version on; older runs carry none and are excluded from the yield
  numbers.

### Fixed

- A permanently broken artwork URL was refetched every few hours despite
  the 6-hour failure cache. Every download stored a cache entry, successes
  included, and since eviction is oldest-first the 1024-slot cache filled
  with entries nothing reads and pushed the real failure entries out before
  their TTL. Only failures are cached now, and a forced retry that succeeds
  clears the entry.

### Changed

- Episode lookups behind the just-in-time serve path are cached for 15
  minutes. A podcast client sends a HEAD for every unprocessed episode on
  each refresh cycle, and each one refetched and reparsed the whole
  upstream RSS feed. Re-rendering a served feed drops that feed's entries,
  and misses are not cached, so a feed caught mid-publish does not 404 for
  the whole window. Adapted from @stansz's fork.

## [2.91.2] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- API keys saved after the container starts now take effect without a
  restart. `AdDetector` and `ChaptersGenerator` are built once at import,
  so a worker that booted before a key was configured cached `None` and
  kept skipping ad detection and chapter generation. Both now resolve the
  key through a property on each access, matching how the LLM client
  already reads through. An explicit key passed to the constructor still
  wins. Reported and fixed by Bryan Leboff (#686).

## [2.91.1] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Third addressing mode `random`: draws timestamps or segment IDs once per
  detection run (and again, independently, for verification), so production
  traffic accumulates an unbiased comparison between the two over time.
- Per-addressing-mode LLM contract compliance stats: runs, windows judged,
  and compliance percentage for each mode, recorded to a new
  `addressing_log` table and exposed via `GET /api/v1/stats/addressing`.
- Addressing modes section on the Stats page showing the above per mode.

### Fixed

- Reviewer prompts now fetch the known-sponsor list once per review pass
  instead of once per prompt.
- The addressing-mode setting persists in the same order as its sibling
  settings during a settings update, instead of ahead of validation of
  the rest of the payload.
- Clearer settings copy for the text recurrence hints toggle.

### Documentation

- Retroactive attribution: the skip-FLAC toggle, ENV_BACKED_SETTINGS
  registry, and parallel detection windows shipped in 2.5.23-2.5.25 were
  first implemented in the leboff/MinusPod fork. The 2.5.23 and 2.5.25
  entries now say so, and the README points at where credit lives.


## [2.91.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Seed-sponsors toggles: four global settings control which LLM prompts
  receive the known-sponsor list (pass 1 detection, pass 2 verification,
  reviewer review, reviewer resurrect). All default on. Turning the
  reviewer toggle off makes that pass an independent second opinion
  instead of one primed with the same sponsor hints as the detector.
  Exposed in the settings API and a new Seed sponsors section in the
  settings UI (#683).
- Cross-episode text recurrence hints (off by default): spans of the
  transcript whose wording repeats near-verbatim across the feed's
  recent episodes are fed to pass-1 detection as a hint for intros,
  credits, and other boilerplate. Text evidence is a hint only and
  never cuts audio on its own. Complements the audio fingerprinter,
  which misses re-recorded boilerplate that is verbatim in words but
  acoustically different each week (#683).
- Experimental segment-ID addressing mode (timestamps remains the
  default): the detector can ask the model for numbered transcript
  line IDs instead of absolute timestamps, then map the IDs back to
  exact Whisper segment times. An invented timestamp is undetectable;
  an invented ID is provably out of range, so bad references are
  dropped instead of cutting the wrong audio. Falls back to timestamp
  parsing when a model ignores the ID contract. Selectable under
  Experiments in the settings UI; benchmark results decide whether the
  default ever changes (#683).

### Documentation

- New glossary entries and configuration sections for seed sponsors,
  text recurrence hints, and the addressing mode; openapi.yaml covers
  the six new settings keys (#683).

## [2.90.1] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Per-category segment actions (keep, beep, remove) now apply in the
  verification pass, not just pass 1. Kept spans become validator
  barriers so merges and end-extension cannot cut through them,
  overlapping beep and remove cuts are reconciled (beep wins contested
  audio, removes split around it), and the audio recut honors the same
  barriers. Ported from the kristofferR fork (#679).
- DAI review safeguards: human review decisions (confirmed spans, trims,
  false-positive rejections) survive automatic boundary mutation, and
  measured DAI evidence (`dai_core_spans`) survives marker merges and
  splits. Confirmed spans clamp exactly, the newest correction wins,
  duplicate fragments of one approved span are rejected with an audit
  flag, and untranscribed sonic tails after a recovered CTA are removed.
  Ported from the kristofferR fork (#680).
- VAD gap extension guardrails: adjacency-only gap extension is capped
  at 60 seconds; larger untranscribed gaps without signoff or resume
  context become held review markers with a `large_vad_gap_extension`
  hold reason, surfaced in the episode detail view. Held markers are
  never merged with other markers. Ported from the kristofferR fork
  (#677).
- Benchmark: stealth/ox-alpha added to the 2026-08 sweep and the
  recommended models table, marked as promotional pricing (#674).

### Fixed

- Ollama reasoning effort is now sent as `reasoning_effort` through the
  OpenAI-compatible API. The previous `options.think` form was silently
  ignored, so the configured effort never reached the model (#678).
- Review hardening of the ported changes: kept audio is barriered on
  every render path (pass 1 and manual recut, not only the pass-2
  recut); pattern-defined keeps never fuse with plain keeps before
  action precedence applies; plain confirmations keep their
  multi-fragment auto-accept; a false-positive rejection extending past
  an adjusted span survives the adjustment; and pass-2 kept-span
  conflicts are screened against false-positive corrections before
  being held for review.
- A boundary adjustment still clamps a re-detection to its approved
  bounds and accepts it, but no longer bypasses the ad reviewer: stored
  bounds can go stale on a DAI feed whose ad timing drifts between
  fetches. Audio a re-detection covers beyond both the reviewed bounds
  and the approved span now validates as its own marker instead of
  being silently discarded by the clamp.

### Security

- Episode artwork reads, stale artwork cleanup, and feed-directory
  deletion now join paths through the containment helper
  (resolve-and-verify) instead of raw path concatenation, closing the
  open CodeQL path-injection findings on storage.py. All three sites
  were already guarded by input validation; this makes the containment
  provable and adds traversal regression tests.

### Changed

- Dependency bumps: anthropic 1.0.0 (temperature now routed via
  `extra_body`, since the 1.0 SDK removed sampling parameters from
  `messages.create`), openai 3.3.1, gunicorn 26.1.0, huggingface-hub
  1.28.0, idna 3.19 (#676); vite 8.2.2, lucide-react 1.33.0,
  @tanstack/react-query 5.101.4, happy-dom 20.11.6, globals 17.11.0,
  docker/setup-buildx-action 4.3.0 (#663-#670).

## [2.89.5] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- A pattern's segment category can now be set everywhere a pattern is
  made or edited: the pattern detail modal gains a Category select, the
  manual ad editor classifies the new marker and its pattern at creation,
  and `PUT /patterns/{id}` and `POST /patterns/import` accept a validated
  `category` field (null clears it; unknown values are rejected).

### Fixed

- A keep-resolving pattern match no longer trims overlapping remove
  detections. Coverage trimming counts only pattern regions whose
  category resolves to remove, so a cross-promo pattern set to keep can
  no longer clip an LLM sponsor detection down to its uncovered
  remainder. Before, that left the ad in the audio with no marker
  responsible for cutting it.
- Disabling a pattern now silences its stored audio fingerprint too. The
  fingerprint loader never checked is_active, so a disabled pattern kept
  producing matches.

## [2.89.4] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Long log lines wrap in the run log viewer instead of pushing the row
  sideways. On phones the time and level sit above the message, so a long
  URL gets the full width.
- Silenced the HTTP transport chatter that openai 3.x reintroduced. That
  release moved to httpx2 and httpcore2, which log under new names, so the
  existing suppression missed them and per-request connection dumps went to
  the server log at DEBUG. They were a quarter of every episode run log.

## [2.89.3] - 2026-08-20

### Changed

- Chunk extraction now runs ahead of the GPU during chunked transcription.
  Two ffmpeg workers cut and normalize upcoming chunks while the current one
  transcribes, instead of the GPU idling through each extraction. On a
  46-minute episode with the large-v3 model this takes roughly five minutes
  off a full run, with the same gain again in the verification pass. A
  mid-run chunk-size change (GPU out-of-memory, extraction timeout) discards
  the queued extractions and redoes them at the new size.
- The log viewer's level pills are now plain filters: none selected shows
  every line, and selecting pills keeps only those levels. They previously
  acted as a minimum-severity threshold, which read as a broken filter when
  Debug was selected and INFO lines still showed.

## [2.89.2] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- Per-run episode logs. Every processing run writes its pipeline log to disk as
  JSONL, and the episode page's new Logs card opens any run's log in a
  full-screen viewer with a minimum-level filter, text search, and a raw
  download. A log holds whatever that run logged, including the lines its
  detection and reviewer worker threads wrote, and a failed run keeps its log.
  A run's log closes when its history row lands, so anything logged after that,
  like the webhook and the RSS refresh, is not in it.
  Retention is 30 days by default, editable in Settings > Global Defaults, where
  0 keeps nothing and lets the cleanup sweep delete what is already stored. Any
  feed can opt in or out in its own settings. Files live under
  `data/logs/episodes/<slug>/<episode-id>/` and stop at 20 MB per run with a
  truncation marker; the cleanup sweep also removes files no run points at.
  `EPISODE_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS` and `EPISODE_LOG_LEVEL` seed the two global
  settings. New endpoint:
  `GET /feeds/<slug>/episodes/<episode-id>/runs/<n>/log`, with `format=raw` for
  the file itself. Closes #660.

## [2.89.1] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Low-ad-yield response policy. When a run MinusPod started itself removes far
  less ad time than the feed's recent average, it can rerun detection
  automatically. Choose the action under Settings > Global Defaults: do nothing
  (the default), redetect ads from the stored transcript, reprocess, or run a
  full analysis. Each feed can override that choice or turn the policy off. The
  episode keeps serving its current audio while the rerun waits its turn, behind
  any fresh episodes in the queue. A rerun happens at most once per episode. The
  mark goes down when the rerun is queued, so a rerun that fails still spends
  it. The policy never fires after a manual reprocess or on a pass-through,
  skip-detection, or cue-only feed. Degraded runs, which publish on partial
  detection, are skipped too, since they already queue their own re-detect.
  Playing an unprocessed episode counts as an automatic run and can trigger the
  policy. `LOW_AD_YIELD_ACTION` seeds the global default on a fresh install; the
  stored setting is editable at runtime.

### Changed

- The Settings page's Processing Queue lists the whole backlog. It showed only
  the active job plus whatever an enqueue path had registered by hand, so a bulk
  reprocess or a feed refresh that queued a dozen episodes looked like one item,
  or like nothing at all. `GET /episodes/processing` now returns the pending
  queue rows in the order the worker claims them, and the panel numbers each
  waiting episode and collapses past ten rows behind a Show all toggle. Cancel
  works per row, so only the row being canceled reads as canceling. The list is
  capped at 200 rows while the heading counts the whole backlog.

### Fixed

- The queue drainer dropped an episode re-queued while its own run was still
  finishing. The queue holds one row per episode, so the drainer's verdict on
  the finished run overwrote that row and the rerun never happened. A verdict
  now only lands on a row the drainer still holds, which also repairs the
  automatic re-detect a degraded run queues for itself.

## [2.89.0] - 2026-08-19

### Security

- Closed a DNS-rebinding TOCTOU in the SSRF guard. Outbound fetches validated
  a hostname's resolved addresses, then let the HTTP client resolve the same
  hostname again to connect, so a record that flipped between the two lookups
  could pass validation on a public address and connect to a private one. A
  new transport now resolves each request and redirect hop once, validates
  every returned address, and connects to the validated addresses in order; the
  URL, `Host` header, SNI, and certificate verification stay on the original
  hostname. A connect failure falls back to the next validated address, each
  tried at most once, so a multi-homed host stays reachable.
  `SSRF_IP_PINNING=false` is the kill switch back to the previous per-request
  resolution, for isolating a fetch failure the pin might cause.

### Added

- Reviewer verdicts carry a structured `is_ad` boolean alongside the existing
  prose, with the prose form kept as a fallback when a model omits the field.
  Contradiction holds, where a verification finding disagrees with a kept
  pass-1 span, key off the structured field when present, and the telemetry
  for a hold now emits once per held span instead of two or three times
  through the different code paths that inspect the same verdict. On a model that emits `is_ad` true for a disputed span, the guard no
  longer holds it, so spans that used to land in Held for Review are now cut.
  Installs running the shipped reviewer prompt unedited pick this up on
  upgrade, since that prompt is re-seeded on startup.
- `AD_DETECTION_MAX_FAILED_WINDOW_RATIO` (default `0.25`). When this fraction
  of a detection or verification pass's windows fail on an LLM error or
  timeout, the whole pass is now treated as failed instead of being accepted
  with the failed windows unexamined. A failed first pass fails the episode
  and the retry ladder picks it up. A failed verification pass leaves the
  first-pass markers and audio as they are, and records the second scan as
  incomplete rather than clean, which also fixes an all-windows-failed
  verification run reading as a clean scan. Set to `1.0` to restore the
  previous behavior. The variable seeds a stored setting that is read on every
  pass, so the threshold can be retuned without a restart. A pass where only
  some windows failed is retried rather than published from pattern matches
  alone, since a provider that answered part of a pass usually answers all of
  it on the retry.
- Community patterns carry a staleness-based trust tier: active (matched
  locally in the last 90 days), unproven (no recent local match), or stale (a
  community pattern with no local match in the last 90 days and no community
  confirmation within a year). A new `community_last_confirmed_at` column and optional
  `last_confirmed_at` corpus field track community confirmation, and the
  Patterns page shows an Unproven or Stale badge; an active pattern gets no
  badge.
- A reviewer calibration self-test (`python -m tools.reviewer_calibration`)
  runs a labeled corpus of ad and non-ad transcripts through the production
  reviewer stack and reports verdict agreement plus how often responses carry
  the structured `is_ad` field. It also runs automatically in a background
  thread whenever the reviewer model setting changes, including a detection
  model change while the reviewer is left on `same_as_pass`, storing its result
  under the `reviewer_calibration_last` setting; a failed or slow run never
  blocks the settings save. Disable the auto-run with
  `reviewer_calibration_on_change` (or `REVIEWER_CALIBRATION_ON_CHANGE`).
- Gunicorn warns at startup when `GUNICORN_WORKERS` is greater than 1 and the
  rate-limit storage is still the default `memory://`, since limiter counters
  are per process and the effective limit multiplies by worker count. Login
  lockout is database-backed and unaffected.
- Unit tests for the heuristic pre-roll and post-roll detector.

### Tooling (benchmark; not in runtime image)

- Two models added to the sweep roster: `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` and
  `google/gemini-3.7-flash`. Both joined the existing 2026-08 campaign against
  the frozen prompt, so no earlier model was re-run.
- `google/gemini-3.7-flash` lands in the top statistical tier at $0.64 per
  episode against `google/gemini-3.6-flash`'s $1.44 for a tied score, so 3.6 has
  no remaining case. `docs/llm-providers.md` updated to say so.
- `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` scores mid-table with brittle JSON and is not a candidate.
- Fresh pricing snapshot, and the previous report archived to
  `results/archive/2026-08-15/`.

### Changed

- openai 2.53.0 to 3.3.0, which migrates the client onto `httpx2`/`httpcore2`;
  anthropic 0.120.2 to 0.124.0; wheel to 0.48.0.
- Frontend: lucide-react to 1.31.0, swagger-ui-dist to 5.32.13, eslint to
  10.8.1, `@testing-library/user-event` to 14.6.4, `@types/react-dom` to
  19.2.4.
- Pass-2 verification reconciliation extracted out of `processing.py` into
  its own module.
- Type hints modernized to PEP 585/604 (`list[str]` over `List[str]`, `X |
  None` over `Optional[X]`), and the ruff lint gate widened from `F` alone to
  also cover `B904`, `B905`, `S608`, `UP006`, `UP045`, and `UP035`. The
  database layer's dynamic SQL is audited and exempted from `S608`: the
  interpolated identifiers are hardcoded or allowlist-validated, and values
  are always bound parameters.
- `zip()` calls pairing same-length lists now pass `strict=True`, which raises
  on a mismatch instead of silently truncating. One of the sites this
  caught was a latent length mismatch: chapter span end times could carry one
  more entry than an empty start-time list, which the strict check now
  prevents from recurring.
- Exception re-raises now chain explicitly (`raise ... from err` or `from
  None`), so a traceback shows the real cause instead of only the immediate
  wrapper.

## [2.88.3] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- The shared processing status file corrupted under concurrent writes, roughly
  1.7 times a day on a two-worker instance. Every writer used one temp filename
  and opened it with `w`, which truncates before the lock is taken, so one
  worker could wipe another's partial write and both renamed the result into
  place. The next reader hit a JSON error and the file was reset, dropping the
  current job, the queue display, and the recorded server start time. Each
  writer now gets its own temp file and an atomic replace, through a shared
  helper that also fixes the identical pattern in the processing queue's own
  state file.
- Status updates were also lost outright between workers, since the only guard
  around read-modify-write was a `threading.Lock` that does not reach past its
  own process. With four concurrent writers, 7 of 40 queue additions survived.
  A file lock now spans workers, and all 40 survive.

- Reading the status file rewrote it whenever it expired a stale job, so a
  status poll could write and the timeout warning fired from whichever SSE
  thread happened to read first. Expiry is now separate: read-only callers
  apply it in memory, and only the paths that were already writing persist it.
  Recovering a corrupt file still rewrites, since that is one-shot.
- Startup reconciliation held the cross-process status lock across a SQLite
  write, which can block for the 30 second busy timeout with every status
  request queued behind it. The database reset now runs outside the lock.
- An SSE subscriber was handed a status snapshot and then discarded it to
  fetch the same data again, costing one extra lock acquisition per open
  stream per update. `to_dict` now accepts the snapshot.
- `_migrate_sponsor_fk` could leave its table rebuild in an open transaction
  and the connection with foreign keys disabled if a step failed, letting a
  later migration commit a half-finished rebuild. It now rolls back, the same
  fix applied to the fingerprint migration.

## [2.88.2] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Pattern deduplication deleted the audio fingerprints of every duplicate it
  merged away, so a survivor could end up with no fingerprint even though a
  duplicate had one. Duplicates share a text template, so that fingerprint
  describes the survivor's audio too; it now moves across when the survivor
  has none. Only fresh audio can rebuild one, and 2.88.1 made the loss likelier
  by ranking operator-written patterns, which rarely carry a fingerprint, above
  auto-learned ones, which usually do. The fingerprint moves only onto an
  active survivor, since fingerprint matching ignores `is_active` and would
  otherwise keep cutting audio the operator had switched off.
- Deduplication ranked a disabled pattern above an active one, so a row the
  operator had switched off could delete the live pattern and absorb its stats.
  Active now outranks tier and confirmation count both.
- Deleting a pattern left its audio fingerprint behind. The matcher loads
  fingerprints without checking that the pattern still exists, so the orphan
  went on cutting the same audio with nothing left to disable or inspect. The
  single and bulk delete paths now take the fingerprint with the pattern, which
  the other deletion paths already did.

### Changed

- `audio_fingerprints.pattern_id` now carries a real foreign key against
  `ad_patterns` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so a fingerprint can no longer outlive
  its pattern because a caller forgot to clean up. Existing databases migrate on
  startup by rebuilding the table. Fingerprints whose pattern is already gone
  cannot satisfy the constraint, so the migration copies them to
  `_orphaned_audio_fingerprints` instead of deleting them, and aborts before the
  destructive step if the row count does not match. Databases created around
  v0.1.107 already carry this constraint, since v0.1.108 dropped it from the
  schema without rebuilding tables that already existed; those are detected and
  left alone.

## [2.88.1] - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- The blocked-agent list moved from the Authenticated Feeds card to Security.
  The gate runs whether or not feed auth is enabled, so the old placement
  implied a dependency that does not exist.

### Fixed

- Held verification conflicts appeared twice in the review queue. 2.88.0 added
  each one to both the held list and the UI list, so the marker saved twice and
  rendered as duplicate cards that shared playback state. They now go to the
  held list only, which is what the function has always documented, and the
  merge that concatenates those two lists drops repeated spans so no future
  path can persist the same pass-2 marker twice.
- `deduplicate_patterns` picked the surviving row by confirmation count alone,
  so an auto-learned pattern could beat and delete one an operator created by
  hand. Tier now outranks confirmation count, and merged stats still carry the
  group total.

## [2.88.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- A Settings list of user agents that must never trigger just-in-time
  processing. A matching request gets a 302 to the origin audio instead of
  a queued transcription and detection run. Matching is case-insensitive
  and looks for the pattern anywhere in the agent string; start a pattern
  with `^` to anchor it to the beginning, which short strings need so they
  cannot match mid-agent. The list is empty by default, so upgrading
  changes nothing until an operator adds a pattern. Closes #645.

### Tooling (benchmark; not in runtime image)

- Six models added to the sweep roster: `bytedance-seed/seed-2-1-turbo`,
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813`, `qwen/qwen3.8-2.4t-a95b`, `x-ai/grok-4.6`,
  `nvidia/nemotron-3.5-lightning`, and `meta/muse-glimmer-30b`. Slugs verified
  against the live OpenRouter catalog.
- `prompts/2026-08.txt`: the 2026-08 campaign's system prompt, frozen. The
  `cross_promo` wording change in 2.86.2 altered `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and
  since `prompt_hash` is part of the work-unit key, every one of the campaign's
  64,125 rows would otherwise be treated as incomplete. Pinning the run to this
  file adds new models to an existing campaign without re-running the old ones.
- Fresh pricing snapshot covering the added models.
- Regenerated report and charts: 81 active models, 69,255 work units, 69,125
  scored. `x-ai/grok-4.6` joins the top statistical tier at F0.5 0.760; the
  other five land between 0.052 and 0.650 and none displaces an existing
  recommendation. `docs/llm-providers.md` refreshed to match.

### Changed

- huggingface-hub 1.26.1 to 1.27.0, which pulls in hf-xet 1.5.1 to 1.6.0.
- The report's "Errors resolved by retry" section is gone. Every row in it had
  already succeeded, so none affected a score, and its contents were either
  duplicated elsewhere or noise: the largest entry restated what the JSON mode
  column already says, and thirteen of fifteen rows covered under 1% of a
  model's work units. Unresolved failures keep their own tables, which is where
  a provider refusal or a rate-limit ceiling actually belongs.
- Provider-policy blocks no longer classify as `Unknown model (404)`. OpenRouter
  answers 404 when an account blocks a provider, so a correct slug read as a
  wrong one; these now bucket as `Account gating (provider policy)`.

### Fixed

- A verification finding that contradicts a kept pass-1 span is now held for
  review instead of being discarded. The keep still stands, so pass 2 never
  cuts through an operator's segment-action choice, but the disagreement is
  visible and one approval away from a cut. Previously it was dropped with
  only a debug line to show for it, so an ad the second pass had caught at
  high confidence vanished silently.
- The "re-cutting pass 1 output" log fired before the filters that decide
  whether anything gets re-cut, so it announced work that often never
  happened. It now reports the actual count, after the gate.
- `benchmark run --dry-run` ignored `--retry-errors`, reporting errored units as
  skipped and under-counting the real queue. The preview now takes the same
  errored-key set the run does.

## [2.87.0] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- Skip-to-content link, so keyboard users can jump past the nav on every
  page.
- `--c-blue`, `--c-purple`, and `--c-teal` design tokens for the accent
  hues the design guide defines, plus `--highlight` for search matches.
  Stage, scope, and category badges now follow the theme instead of
  carrying fixed Tailwind hues.
- `frontend/src/components/fieldStyles.ts`: shared focus-ring, text-input,
  and select recipes, the counterpart to the existing `buttonStyles.ts`.
- `DraftNumberInput`: the numeric field for settings where a blank value
  means "inherit the default", promoted out of `StageTunablesSection` so
  every such field shares one implementation.
- `docs/workflows.md`: a visual map of episode processing. Eight generated
  SVG diagrams (light and dark) covering how work reaches the queue, the
  eleven pipeline stages, the five evidence sources and five marker
  outcomes, the five per-feed processing modes, the four re-run modes, the
  pattern learning loop, and what happens when a stage fails. Linked from
  the project README and the docs index.
- `scripts/generate_workflow_diagrams.py`: builds those diagrams from the
  `frontend/src/index.css` design tokens, so they follow the app's own
  light and dark palettes.
- Mobile card layout for the episode processing-runs table, which
  previously only rendered as a horizontally scrolled 11-column table.

### Changed

- Dialogs are now reachable by keyboard: `Modal` sets `role="dialog"` and
  `aria-modal`, traps Tab inside the panel, restores focus to whatever
  opened it, and closes on Escape by default.
- Dropdown menus support Arrow, Home, and End navigation, expose menu
  roles and `aria-expanded`, and return focus to their trigger on close.
- Every button, link, select, and textarea shows a visible focus ring.
  Coverage went from 69 of roughly 430 controls to all of them.
- The five `window.confirm` prompts became in-app confirmation dialogs, so
  destructive actions are styled, themed, and screen-reader reachable.
- Checkboxes and numeric inputs across the app render through the shared
  `Checkbox`, `NumberInput`, and `DraftNumberInput` components rather than
  hand-rolled markup. `Checkbox` gained `label` and `id` props to support
  both plain rows and rows whose whole body is the click target.
- Selects collapsed from 20 hand-written class recipes onto one.
- Badges use the design guide's single shape; the pill-shaped variants and
  the shadow on the login card are gone.

### Fixed

- Chunk extraction no longer times out on long chunks and then blames the
  source file for it (#644). The ffmpeg budget scales with chunk length the
  way every other ffmpeg call site already did, a timeout reports itself as
  a timeout with the budget and chunk length instead of asserting a decode
  failure, and the first timeout halves the chunk and retries once rather
  than repeating the same doomed call through the whole retry ladder.
- Status and stage colors now respond to all 20 themes. 341 hardcoded
  Tailwind color classes across roughly 40 files moved onto design tokens,
  along with the remaining hardcoded hex values in the charts, the
  waveform fallback, and the search highlight.

### Dependencies

- vite 8.1.5 to 8.2.1, @vitejs/plugin-react 6.0.3 to 6.0.5,
  typescript-eslint and @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin to 8.67.0,
  happy-dom to 20.11.2, openai 2.51.0 to 2.53.0, huggingface-hub 1.26.0
  to 1.26.1.

## [2.86.4] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- 2026-08 LLM benchmark sweep: 75 models, 14-episode corpus, 64,125 work
  units, with regenerated report and charts. New in the report: a failure
  category for provider content moderation (was buried in "Other"), an
  "Errors resolved by retry" table built from the append-only raw rows, and
  corpus-derived Metric Key text instead of stale hardcoded episode counts.
- `results/parse-and-moderation.md`: companion analysis of the two failure
  modes retrying never fixes, provider content refusal and unparseable
  JSON, with every example linked to its raw call.
- Four new report views: a "windows flagged with no truth ad" table
  ranking ground-truth-free windows by model consensus (doubles as truth
  QA), signed boundary bias columns showing whether a model's cuts lean
  into content or leave ad audio, an accuracy-vs-latency scatter, and an
  input-vs-output cost split (table plus chart).
- `benchmark rotate-raw` and campaign archiving, so a new sweep's rows
  cannot silently blend with the previous campaign's.
- Benchmark CONTRIBUTING: corpus wishlist for outside episode PRs, campaign
  rotation notes, and a zero-cost `benchmark report` preview step for
  report code changes.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `claude_model`, `verification_model`, and `chapters_model`
  no longer seed or reset to a hardcoded literal. They seed from
  `OPENAI_MODEL` when the operator has set it and stay unset otherwise;
  resetting one (individually, via a provider change, or via the bulk
  ad-detection reset) clears it back to unset instead of writing a shipped
  default. An install that relied on the old shipped default must
  configure a model explicitly in Settings (or via `OPENAI_MODEL`) after
  any of those resets.
- `docs/llm-providers.md` model recommendations refreshed from the 2026-08
  sweep, including a note on provider-side content moderation.
- An unconfigured model (`claude_model`, `verification_model`, or
  `chapters_model` unset) is no longer a silent failure. Boot logs one
  error line naming the missing settings, `/health` adds an
  `llm_model_configured` check without affecting overall status, ad
  detection fails the episode immediately with the exact error message
  instead of exhausting the retry ladder, and chapter generation degrades
  to fallback titles and boundaries instead of failing the episode.

### Fixed

- A non-Anthropic install carrying a shipped Anthropic model id from the
  old hardcoded-default seeding has it cleared on upgrade, so it fails
  with an actionable message instead of looping on a provider 404. The
  clear is limited to that case: a model you chose yourself, and a shipped
  default that still resolves on an Anthropic install, are both left
  alone.
- Model settings now seed from `OPENAI_MODEL` whenever a row is absent.
  The previous seed path only fired on an empty settings table, which
  never happened in practice because schema migrations always populate
  other rows first.
- An unrecognized `LLM_PROVIDER` value is rejected with a warning instead
  of being written into the stored setting verbatim.
- Cross-model agreement chart was unreadable at 75 models: every integer
  got an x tick so the labels ran together, and the two-line bar labels
  overlapped each other. Ticks now thin out to about 25 across any
  model count, and bar labels rotate to a single line once the chart passes
  30 bars.

### Security

- cryptography 49.0.0 to 50.0.0 (PYSEC-2026-3552), transitive fast-uri
  (GHSA-7p8r-x3mc-p8w7), and transitive nanoid (GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8).
  All three were failing the CI audit gates.

## [2.86.2] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Circuit-breaker-masked auth outages now freeze the retry budget like
  direct auth failures.
- Title blacklist helper text explains whole-title glob matching and uses
  a neutral example.

## [2.86.1] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Global "process new episodes first" setting controlling the automatic
  fresh-episode queue boost.

### Fixed

- Global show-segments toggle saves immediately instead of waiting for
  Save Changes.
- Per-prompt reset buttons stay visible at default, disabled instead of
  hidden.
- Feed show-segments control is an explicit Inherit/On/Off choice that
  shows the effective value when inheriting.

## [2.86.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- Two-tier pattern trust: user-created and community patterns are marked
  "defined"; auto-learned patterns are not. Defined status now drives cut,
  merge, and pass-1 hint behavior throughout the detection pipeline.
- Feed queue priority (#625): normal, high, or low, with automatic boosts
  for episodes published in the last 48 hours and for episodes a user
  explicitly reprocesses. Boosts stack on top of the feed's base priority.
- Per-feed episode title blacklist: case-insensitive glob patterns skip
  queuing and just-in-time processing for matching episodes. A per-feed
  choice serves a skipped episode unmodified in the RSS feed or hides it
  entirely.
- Per-prompt reset buttons in settings (#626): each AI prompt resets to its
  default individually instead of only all-or-nothing.
- A dedicated global Segment actions settings card, plus a global default
  for show-segments (intro/outro/recap) detection that feeds inherit
  unless they set their own value.
- Partial detection: when the AI detection pass fails but pattern and
  cross-fetch evidence already produced cuts, the episode publishes with a
  warning banner and a re-run button instead of failing outright. Window
  counts are exposed in the API, and one automatic low-priority re-detect
  is queued.

### Changed

- A user-created or community ad pattern now always cuts its matched
  segment, overriding segment-action keep settings. This applies to both
  the keep partition and the late keep safety net; auto-learned patterns
  are unaffected and still respect keep settings.
- Text-pattern merging: when a defined pattern overlaps an auto-learned
  one, the defined pattern wins ownership of the merged span. The absorbed
  pattern keeps credit for its own matches.
- Pattern learning dedupe: learning a near-identical text now updates the
  existing pattern instead of inserting a duplicate. Only spans that pass
  the learning validation guards count toward match-credit stats.
- Pass-1 sponsor hint amplified: defined patterns now contribute category
  and an opening snippet to the hint; auto-learned patterns contribute
  names only. The detailed list is capped, and neither tier contributes
  match spans or timestamps.
- Default detection prompt: a paid read for another show is now classified
  as sponsor rather than cross_promo. Instances running a customized
  detection prompt need to reset it to pick up this change.
- Differential holds now corroborate against all merged member stages
  instead of a single stage; merged marker labels follow whichever member
  covers the marker.
- Duration-estimated pattern spans are now advisory only: they no longer
  contribute to hold corroboration or label reach. The estimated flag
  survives match merges conservatively, so a merge with any estimated
  member stays advisory.
- Validator merge is now action- and cut-status-aware. A recut can no
  longer restore (un-cut) an ad segment that was already cut.

### Fixed

- An aborted verification pass, one where transcription failed or produced
  no segments, no longer reports a clean scan.
- #629: widened matching for JSON-mode rejection responses, plus runtime
  self-correction that retries without JSON mode. A speculative JSON-mode
  fallback for unprobed endpoints now persists only after it succeeds,
  reverting on any retry failure.
- #631: LLM responses wrapped in a `segments` field now parse ads that are
  missing a `type` field.
- Merge propagation: a defined pattern folding into a claude-first marker,
  or an estimated span promoted to a merged marker's stage, now carries its
  flag through detector and validator merges instead of losing it mid-fold.
- Auth-class LLM failures (invalid key, forbidden, unauthorized) no longer
  consume the episode's retry budget.
- Markers persisted by a failed processing run no longer display as cut
  ads.
- TTL caches are now bounded with a size cap and eviction, rather than
  growing without limit (#621).

## [2.85.2] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Episode covers are fetched and cached by MinusPod rather than loaded from
  the publisher. Publishers reject images requested with a cross-site
  Referer, which is what a browser sends for a hot-linked image, so covers
  that worked for months turn into grey placeholders with nothing in the
  logs to explain it. Serving them ourselves also keeps listener IPs off
  the publisher. Cached covers are capped per feed, least recently served
  dropped first. Generated RSS still points episode art at the publisher,
  where podcast apps fetch it without trouble.
- A Delete feed button on the feed page, so removing a feed no longer means
  going back to the dashboard first. It is the same button and the same
  click-twice confirm the dashboard already uses.

### Fixed

- Deleting a feed no longer leaves rows pointing at it. Ad patterns and ad
  reviewer log entries key on the slug as plain text with no foreign key, so
  they outlived the feed, as did the fingerprints and corrections hanging
  off those patterns. A re-added feed takes the same slug, so it inherited
  the old feed's patterns and applied one show's learning to another.
  Feed-scoped patterns now go with the feed; wider-scoped ones keep their
  learning and drop the dead reference.
- Endpoints podcast apps fetch no longer set a session and CSRF cookie
  neither can use. The session cookie carried a `Vary: Cookie` that stopped
  any CDN caching cover art and audio.

## [2.84.5] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- The experimental label on the per-feed pair-synthesis override no longer
  pushes its dropdown out of line with the rest of the cue tuning controls.
  It now sits at the end of the row, after the "Empty = use global" hint.

## [2.84.4] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- `react-dom` is pinned to the same version as `react` again. A dependency
  bump moved `react` to 19.2.8 and left `react-dom` at 19.2.7, and React
  refuses to run when the two differ, which stopped every frontend test file
  from loading. Production builds strip that check, so the shipped UI was not
  affected, but the mismatch is unsupported either way.
- A podcast whose artwork URL serves the wrong content type is no longer
  refetched on every feed refresh. The download failed, left the cached flag
  unset, and so ran again the next cycle, costing a request and a warning
  every few minutes for as long as the publisher's host stayed broken. A
  failed URL is now remembered for six hours. Changing the artwork URL, or
  refreshing artwork by hand, retries at once.
- Container startup reports when it cannot change ownership of entries under
  the data directory, rather than continuing silently (issue #604). A
  container that dropped `CAP_CHOWN` fails every entry, and without the
  warning the only symptom was the app being unable to write.
- Sponsor guessing no longer treats a capitalized filler word as a brand.
  The word after an ad transition phrase was compared against the skip list
  with its original case, so a transcript reading "brought to you by The
  folks at ..." produced a sponsor named "The", and "by Today Show" produced
  "Today". Split patterns feed this name to the known-sponsor table, so a
  junk brand could be created there. The comparison now folds case and also
  rejects the shared extraction-failure vocabulary the detector and pattern
  creation already use, plus show-credit verbs such as "produced", which
  follow the sponsor read closely enough to be picked up as brands.

## [2.84.3] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Cue-driven ad cutting is now labelled experimental in the UI: the global
  "Create ads from cue pairs" toggle, the per-feed pair-synthesis override, and
  the cue-only processing preset. These are the paths that can cut audio from
  audio-cue evidence alone, without an LLM reading the span. Cue snapping and
  silence snapping are deliberately not labelled, since they only move the
  edges of a cut the detector already found.

## [2.84.2] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- An unrecognized `WHISPER_DEVICE` now transcribes on CPU with a warning
  instead of failing every chunk (issue #605). CTranslate2 accepts only `cpu`
  and `cuda`, and the value went to it unvalidated while the CUDA availability
  check and the compute-type fallback were both keyed on the exact string
  `cuda`, so a near miss such as `gpu` skipped every guard and left gaps in the
  transcript. The system status endpoint now reports the effective device
  rather than the raw setting.
- The container startup ownership scan says so when it cannot read part of the
  data directory, instead of reporting zero unowned files. A container without
  `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` cannot traverse every entry, and a silent zero reads as
  "nothing to migrate".

### Changed

- The GPU image now ships PyTorch built against CUDA 12.9 instead of 12.6, so
  it carries kernels for Blackwell cards (sm_120, the RTX 50 series) and for
  sm_100. Still a CUDA 12.x wheel, so the driver floor stays at 525. The trade
  is that CUDA 12.9 drops the sm_50, sm_60, and sm_70 kernels 12.6 carried, so
  Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta cards will now print an unsupported-architecture
  warning from PyTorch. Transcription is unaffected on those cards because
  CTranslate2 does the transcribing and is compiled separately; PyTorch is
  only used here to report VRAM, and a failed reading falls back to default
  chunk sizing. The GPU image grows by about 1.6 GB.

## [2.84.1] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Ad detections are no longer dropped when a local model answers with the
  singular `{"ad": [...]}` wrapper instead of `{"ads": [...]}`. The response
  parser already accepted several wrapper spellings but not this one, so a
  window with real detections parsed as zero ads. Seen with Ollama models
  such as qwen2.5, which have no strict schema enforcement to hold them to
  the requested key. Thanks to @combwizard for the report and the fix
  (PR #603).
- Container startup no longer skips the data-directory ownership migration
  when `find` cannot read part of the volume (issue #604). Under
  `set -o pipefail` an unreadable entry failed the whole pipeline, and the
  inline `|| echo 0` fallback appended a second value instead of replacing
  the count, leaving `0\n0` for the numeric comparison to reject with an
  arithmetic syntax error. Installs on network-mounted volumes (NFS with
  root_squash, for example) hit this most often, which is also where the
  ownership migration matters most.

## [2.84.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Per-feed processing mode is now a single writable preset instead of three
  separate controls. `processingMode` on the feed PATCH endpoint accepts
  `standard`, `keep_content`, `skip_detection`, or `passthrough` and writes
  the underlying `passthroughEnabled`, `skipAdDetection`, and `detectionMode`
  columns canonically in one request; sending it together with any of those
  three fields is rejected with a 400. The three legacy fields are still
  accepted on their own for existing API callers. Feed settings now offer
  one "Processing mode" select covering all four states, replacing the old
  detection-mode dropdown plus the separate "Skip ad detection" and
  "Pass-through" toggles.
- New `cue_only` processing mode: cuts come from cue pairs and previously
  learned ad patterns, with no LLM detection call. It requires the feed to have
  at least one enabled `ad_break_start` template and one enabled
  `ad_break_end` template; enabling the mode is rejected with a 400
  otherwise, since a boundary-only cue (the `ad_break_boundary` type) can
  pair across show content without an LLM pass to catch the mistake.
  Fingerprint, text-pattern, and cross-fetch differential detection still
  run; the LLM detection pass, LLM reviewer, pass-2 verification, and LLM
  redetection are all off in this mode (redetection returns a 409).
- Per-feed `cueOnlySafety` policy for `cue_only` feeds. `hold_new` (the
  default) holds a template's synthesized cuts for review until it has 3
  episodes with a paired start/end match; `auto_cut` cuts immediately but
  still holds any pair scoring below 0.90 confidence. Holds carry the new
  `cue_template_unproven` or `cue_low_confidence` reason.
- Cue template drift detection: the template list now shows each template's
  last match and a "quiet" badge, and a `cue_only` run fires the new
  `Cue Template Quiet` webhook and email event when a previously-matching
  enabled template records no matches across the feed's last 5
  telemetry-recorded episodes.
- Per-feed `skipTranscription` toggle, valid only under `cue_only` mode.
  Skipping transcription stops generated chapters and removes transcript
  search and VTT subtitles for those episodes, but publisher chapters
  (embedded ID3 or linked Podcasting 2.0 JSON) still get remapped onto the
  cut audio. Runs are labeled "(cue-only)" and, when transcription is
  skipped, also "(no transcript)" in the episode's run list.

### Fixed

- Cue-only template eligibility is now enforced on template edits and
  deletes, not just on the `processingMode` PATCH. Disabling, retyping, or
  deleting a `cue_only` feed's last enabled `ad_break_start` or
  `ad_break_end` template returns a 409 instead of silently leaving the feed
  unable to cut anything; a network-scope template mutation checks every
  sibling feed on the network too, not just the template's owner.

## [2.83.3] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Episodes now show their own cover art in the episode list and on the
  episode page, falling back to the feed cover when an episode does not
  declare one.

### Fixed

- Channel metadata is now read from the raw `<channel>` children instead of
  the parsed feed dictionary (#596). The parser folds channel-level elements
  it does not recognise into the channel itself, so a feed carrying a
  Podcasting 2.0 `<podcast:liveItem>` reported the live episode's blurb as
  the show description, its chat link as the show website, and its author
  and categories as the show's, both in the web UI and in the feed served to
  podcast apps. This also separates `<description>` from `<itunes:summary>`,
  which the parser had aliased onto each other: a feed whose two differ now
  publishes the `<description>` it actually declares, so some stored
  descriptions change on the next refresh.
- A feed that changed its cover art kept serving the old image (#596). The
  refresh writes the new artwork URL to the podcast row before the download
  step re-reads that row to decide whether the cover is already cached, so
  the check compared the new URL against itself, always matched, and skipped
  the fetch. A changed URL now forces the download, and the cache flag is
  cleared with the URL so a failed download is retried. Feeds already stuck
  cannot be repaired by change detection alone, since the stored URL is the
  new one while the image on disk is the old one, so upgrading also queues a
  single artwork re-download for every feed.
- "Refresh artwork" re-pulls the cover again. It read the stored URL back off
  the row and passed it to the same guard that compares against that row, so
  the check always matched and only the badge variant was rebuilt.
- The feed API handed back the publisher's own artwork URL whenever the cover
  was not cached, so an http:// cover arrived inside an https page and the
  browser blocked it, leaving a placeholder. It now uses the proxied endpoint
  whenever the file is on disk, and falls back to the publisher's URL only
  over https, which keeps covers that were rejected at cache time rendering.
- Feed title, description, and artwork only refreshed when the publisher's
  body changed, so a steady feed answering 304 kept whatever it had when it
  was added, including descriptions stored under the old 500-character cap.
  A feed whose metadata has not yet been read this way now does one full
  fetch the next time it answers 304, spread across normal refresh cycles.
  Changes are logged, so a title, description, artwork, or website edit
  upstream is visible in the refresh log. A publisher who replaces the image
  at an unchanged URL is still not picked up, since nothing revalidates the
  bytes behind a URL that did not change.
- Feeds declaring an encoding they do not actually use no longer store
  mojibake. The body is decoded once on fetch, and the channel read no
  longer re-applies the declared encoding on top of that.
- The episode API no longer returns a cover URL that is not https. There is
  no episode artwork proxy to fall back to, so an insecure URL would only be
  blocked by the browser; clients use the feed cover instead.

## [2.83.1] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Per-feed "Skip verification pass" toggle (#599). The pass-2 verification
  scan re-transcribes the cut audio and runs a second full detection sweep
  over it, which roughly doubles the ad-detection LLM spend on every episode.
  It had no toggle at any scope. Feed settings now has a per-feed switch that
  skips it, so a feed whose first pass is already reliable pays for one
  detection sweep instead of two. Held differential detections that pass 2
  would have confirmed wait for a human instead. The toggle reuses a column
  of the same name from the old two-pass era, so upgrading resets any value
  left over from it and the toggle starts off on every feed. A skipped run
  records no verification result rather than a zero, which would have read as
  a clean second scan, and the run list labels it "(no verification)".

### Fixed

- An oversized learned-pattern span could swallow a precise LLM detection
  and then hold the whole thing, leaving the ad in the audio. A pattern
  span is minted from a stored average duration; on one episode it ran 62
  seconds past the actual read, the exact 0.98-confidence LLM detection
  inside it was dropped as already covered, and the bloated marker was held
  because its edges sat far from any splice evidence. When exactly one
  high-confidence cut-resolving LLM detection sits inside a pattern span
  that materially overshoots it, the span now adopts the LLM bounds.
- A feed body cut mid-character parsed as a short but valid feed. The
  truncation detector matched the parser's missing-element errors but not
  "not well-formed (invalid token)", which is what a partial multibyte
  sequence produces; it is now treated as truncation, so the stored episode
  list survives.
- HTTP 404s from unknown-path scanner probes logged at warning in the
  access log even after the application-level line was demoted; both now
  log at info.
- The waveform editor opened on the wrong part of the episode at maximum
  zoom when reached from the Patterns page. Neither the Ad Review nor the
  Detected Ads tab passed the episode length, so the editor fell back to
  assuming a six-minute episode and clamped the window to the end of that
  imaginary range. The detections API now carries the episode duration and
  both tabs pass it through.

## [2.83.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Cover-art badge corner is configurable (#600). The MinusPod badge was
  pinned to the bottom-right, where it covered the network logo on some
  shows. A new "Badge position" select under Settings > Cover Art picks
  bottom-right (default), bottom-left, top-right, or top-left, and
  `ARTWORK_BADGE_POSITION` seeds it on a fresh deploy. The corner is part
  of the badge cache key, and changing it clears the feed validators so the
  served feeds re-render with a fresh cover URL instead of waiting for the
  publisher to change something.

## [2.82.2] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Per-feed switch to serve MinusPod episode ids as RSS item GUIDs (#598).
  The served feed previously mixed GUID schemes: upstream entries kept the
  publisher's GUID while DB-appended episodes used MinusPod ids. New feeds
  serve MinusPod ids from the first fetch; existing feeds keep upstream
  GUIDs unless the new "Serve MinusPod episode IDs" toggle in feed settings
  is turned on. Caveat: switching an already-subscribed feed changes every
  item GUID, so podcast apps treat each episode as new one time.

### Fixed

- Settings card carets behaved differently per card: half rotated in place
  and half jumped down a line on expand, because an appearing subtitle grew
  the header under a centered caret (#597). The caret is pinned to the
  title line, so every card rotates in place.

## [2.82.1] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Editable chapter generation prompt: the topic-detection prompt is now a
  settings-backed template (`chapterPrompt`) with placeholders for the split
  count, segment range, continuation/description/hint blocks, and transcript,
  plus a `chapterPromptOverride` appended at run time. Editable in Settings
  under Prompts and included in the prompts reset; left at the default it
  renders the same prompt as before.

### Changed

- The four Chapter Density tunables (target chapter length, transcript window,
  maximum chapters, shortest chapter) moved from LLM Tunables to the
  Transcripts & Chapters card, next to the Generate Chapters toggle, with
  their own Save button. The settings API payload is unchanged.

### Fixed

- Feed descriptions were stored clipped to 500 characters, which read as
  visible truncation on the feed page once the UI stopped line-clamping
  them (#596). The stored bound is now 10000 characters, which no real
  description reaches; the full text appears after the feed's next refresh.
- A section header action, such as the model-list refresh, no longer
  renders a button nested inside the section's toggle button.

## [2.82.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added

- Detected Ads tab on the patterns page: browse every ad that was cut,
  across all feeds, filtered by podcast, segment category, and search,
  sorted by date, confidence, or podcast. The header leads with total time
  cut, then detection count, distinct sponsors, and distinct podcasts, with a
  per-category breakdown. Rows play the span, open it in the waveform editor,
  reject it (which recuts from the retained original so the audio comes back),
  or split it.
- Segment category filter on the patterns list and the ad review tab, with a
  separate Uncategorized option for markers no detection stage classified.
- Split a merged multi-sponsor ad marker into N single-sponsor ads
  (issue #563), from a Detected Ads row or from inside the boundary review
  editor. A new split-candidates endpoint finds ad-transition phrases in
  the marker's transcript and maps each to a timestamp, so the editor opens
  with dividers where a split would cut. Dividers are draggable and
  keyboard-operable, each resulting ad takes its own sponsor, and saving
  replaces the one marker with N markers and mints one pattern per piece.
  Every piece must clear the minimum ad duration or the split is refused and
  the marker is left untouched. This closes the issue: the automatic
  multi-sponsor split shipped in 2.70.0 and the editor affordance for held and
  not-cut rows in 2.72.0.
- Configurable chapter density via four new LLM tunables: target chapter
  length, transcript window per detection call, maximum chapters, and shortest
  chapter. Available in Settings under LLM Tunables and via the settings API.

### Fixed

- Episode discovery silently dropped episodes when SQLite was busy. The upsert
  ran on a bare connection, so the deferred transaction upgraded to a write
  lock at the first insert, which fails immediately with "database is locked"
  rather than waiting on busy_timeout, and a per-episode handler swallowed it.
  A contended refresh logged one warning per episode and reported success
  having discovered nothing. The batch now holds an immediate transaction,
  lock failures abort it so the caller retries the feed, and per-row data
  faults collapse into one summary warning.
- A truncated feed response was parsed as a short but valid feed, so episodes
  vanished from that feed on every refresh while the circuit breaker recorded a
  success. The shared streaming reader enforced only an upper size bound and
  returned whatever arrived; it now rejects a body that ends short of its
  declared Content-Length, and both RSS fetch paths treat that as a fetch
  failure so the stored episode list survives. A feed document whose parse
  error signals truncation is likewise rejected rather than parsed partially.
- Chapter generation capped every episode at 6 topic boundaries regardless of
  length, and a single detection call over a long transcript clustered the
  boundaries it did return, leaving hour-long chapters at the end. Detection
  now runs per transcript window with the previous window's title carried
  forward, and a failed window no longer discards the others' results. The
  boundary parser also accepts timestamps past 99:59, which windowed
  detection produces on every episode longer than that, and show-notes
  timestamp anchors now reach every window instead of only the first.
- Transcription repeated the same CUDA out-of-memory failures on every
  episode. Batch size came from audio duration alone, so on a card where the
  top tier never fits, each episode paid two OOM failures before settling on a
  size that worked and then discarded that result. The working size is now
  remembered per device.
- The scheduled-backup warning about provider secrets fired on the wrong
  condition. It warned when a master passphrase was configured, which is
  exactly when those secrets are already encrypted at rest, and said nothing
  in the case where they are stored in plaintext. It now warns when plaintext
  secrets are present, names the remedy, and logs once per process rather than
  once per backup.
- Podping node failures logged a warning on every attempt, so a node that
  stayed down printed once a minute indefinitely even though failover was
  working. A node now warns on its first failure, repeats drop to debug, and
  losing every node escalates to an error, which is the case that loses
  pings.
- Unauthenticated requests for feed assets and probes for unknown feed slugs
  logged at warning level, putting routine internet background noise at the
  same level as problems worth acting on. Both drop to info. Failed login
  attempts stay at warning.
- Waveform editor boundary pins declared themselves as sliders to assistive
  technology but had no keyboard handling and no minimum or maximum, so they
  were announced as operable and were not. Arrow keys now nudge them, Shift
  takes a coarser step, and both bounds are exposed.
- Scope, Origin, and Source filter labels on the patterns list were not
  associated with their controls, so none were reachable by label.
- Boundary heuristics could undo a cue-anchored edge and swallow neighbouring
  audio, leaving a real ad in the episode. A text-pattern match landed on an
  ad and cue snapping anchored its end to the feed's learned ad-break
  stinger, then phrase refinement and the content-extension walk moved both
  edges into surrounding speech, across a segment the detector had decided
  to keep. The bloated marker was held for review because its edges were no
  longer near any splice evidence, and a precise LLM detection of the same
  ad had been dropped as redundant, so nothing was cut. Cue-snapped edges
  are now pinned against phrase and content heuristics, the extension walk
  stops at a neighbouring detection's span including segments the feed
  keeps, and a learned template cue firing at a marker edge now counts as
  splice evidence for the veto.
- A marker could end past the end of the file. The validator clamps bounds
  to the episode duration, but protected merge bookkeeping recorded before
  the clamp let the reviewer re-expand the edge past it; the protected
  bounds are now clamped the same way.
- Requesting cover art for a feed slug that does not exist created that
  slug's directory on disk, so scanner probes left orphan directories for
  the refresh cycle to clean up. Artwork reads no longer create anything.
- The corrections endpoint documentation described a request shape the
  server never accepted; it now documents the real one, including the
  trimmed-approval and split fields.

## [2.81.23] - 2026-07-28

### Security

- Sponsor extraction is bounded again. The domain pattern had an unbounded
  character run, the polynomial-ReDoS shape fixed in 1.1.1, and the brand
  search was quadratic in a reason's word count with no cap. A 32 KB reason
  took 12 seconds and a 1500-word one 109 seconds; both now finish in under a
  millisecond.

### Fixed

- A reason that only describes editorial content no longer yields a sponsor
  name, or counts as evidence the span is an ad. The labeler takes the first
  capitalized word of any sentence, so "Discussion of the guest's new book"
  gave "Discussion", and the detection gate read that name as proof the span
  was an ad, skipping the low-confidence rejection. Prose that never mentions
  advertising now names no advertiser, and the gate asks the question itself.
  A negated mention ("not a sponsor read") does not count either.
- The Settings test-connection probe follows the request timeout, capped at
  120 seconds. A backend slow enough to need a raised timeout could also be
  slow to cold-load a model, so the button failed while transcription worked.
- A sponsor label no longer loses its first word when that word also appears in
  ad vocabulary. "Full Circle" was being cut to "Circle". The label is narrowed
  only where a URL in the same reason says where the brand starts and ends, so
  "Full ZipRecruiter sponsor read" with ZipRecruiter.com still resolves to
  ZipRecruiter.
- Both export paths omit an unset category rather than writing an explicit
  null. Importing that null wrote a present-and-None category back into the
  database, the representation the read layer drops because it defeats a
  `.get('category', default)`.

### Changed

- Same-sponsor merging, boundary relocation and pattern learning all read the
  brand from a reason the same way the marker label does. Each had its own
  rules, so an ad could merge, relocate or be learned under a name other than
  the one on the marker.
- `WHISPER_API_TIMEOUT` and a direct database write are clamped to the range
  the API enforces, the way the chunk settings already were.
- Words the model uses to describe an ad's shape ("orphaned", "back", "block")
  are read only by the sponsor labeler. They had also been filtering
  boundary-relocation keywords, where dropping them cost hits.

## [2.81.22] - 2026-07-28

### Added

- Feeds show whether Podping covers them. The line reads `Podping: last ping at
  <time>` once a notification has arrived for that feed, `Podping: enabled, none
  received yet` when the feed's own tag declares `usesPodping="true"` but nothing
  has come in, and `Podping: never` otherwise. It stays hidden while the listener
  is off, since that is an instance-wide setting rather than a fact about the
  feed. The list views show a shorter form of the same line.
- MinusPod reads the upstream `<podcast:podping>` tag. A feed can name the
  accounts allowed to podping it with `<podcast:hiveAccount account="...">`,
  and MinusPod ignores podpings for that feed from anyone else. A feed
  carrying `usesPodping="false"` is asking to be polled, so MinusPod skips
  podping refreshes for it and reports it as declined. Feeds that say nothing
  accept any sender, since the tag is optional and there is nothing to check
  against. Scheduled polling stays the fallback either way, and the global
  Podping toggle is still the master switch.
- Ad length limits are settings now, global and per feed, in the UI and the
  API. "Ad length needing a confirmed sponsor" (default 300s) and "Longest ad
  to cut at all" (default 900s) sit in Settings under ad detection, and a feed
  can override the first from its settings panel. A show with long ad blocks no
  longer depends on the defaults happening to suit it. The two are validated
  against each other: the confirmation threshold cannot be set above the hard
  ceiling, since that would make confirming a sponsor shorten what may be cut.
- The sound that plays where an ad was cut can be changed from Settings, under
  Audio. The section plays the current file, states its length, channels and
  sample rate, and takes an upload of MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG or FLAC. Uploads are
  transcoded to MP3 and capped at 5 MB and 30 seconds, since every cut becomes
  as long as this file. `Use the default` restores the shipped sound, which is
  what a fresh install still plays.

  A duration bar sizes the replacement against the content on either side of
  it, so a file long enough to pad out every ad break shows that before you
  install it. A mono upload is flagged, because an episode whose first cut
  starts at 0:00 takes the replacement's channel count and would come out mono.

  New endpoints: `GET`, `POST` and `DELETE /settings/replacement-audio`, plus
  `GET /settings/replacement-audio/file` for the preview.
- Kept segments on the episode page collapse, and each row has a play button.
  The list was always open and unplayable, so a show with several kept
  categories pushed the rest of the page down and gave no way to hear what had
  been left in. It now matches Detections Not Cut next to it: a count in the
  header, and the open or closed state is remembered. The play button uses the
  retained original audio and only appears when that audio is still on disk.
- The feeds API reports the fuller picture the line no longer shows.
  `podpingCoverage` separates a publisher opt-out, a publisher opt-in with no
  ping yet, a host seen pinging other feeds, and nothing known, and the parsed
  declaration comes back as `podpingUses` and `podpingHiveAccounts`. A feed
  declaring `usesPodping="true"` previously got no credit for it anywhere,
  since the value was stored and never read back.
- `GET /api/v1/podping/hosts` lists the domains the listener has seen sending
  podpings, with first and last seen times, a ping count, and whether each
  falls inside the active window. Counts are aggregated per domain as the
  listener runs, so there is no per-notification history. It also answers
  whether the listener is recording at all, since a feed reading as uncovered
  otherwise looks identical to a listener seeing no traffic.

- The time MinusPod waits for each transcription request to a remote Whisper
  backend is a setting now, under Transcription (#593). A self-hosted backend
  that needs minutes per chunk returned 0 segments and failed the job, with no
  way to wait longer short of shrinking the chunk size. Default is unchanged at
  600 seconds; `WHISPER_API_TIMEOUT` sets it from the environment. Note that a
  proxy in front of the backend can still cut the request sooner, which looks
  identical from here.

### Changed

- An ad past the length ceiling whose only fault is its length is held for
  review instead of rejected. A reject left no marker at all, so a whole break
  disappeared with nothing to look at or approve. Whether a long break was cut
  came down to which side of a fixed 0.90 confidence line it landed on. One
  episode's 415-second break was cut at 0.90. The next episode's 374-second
  break was dropped just under it.
- A sponsor named in a long ad's own audio counts as confirmation of the read,
  but it now takes two mentions rather than one. A misdetected span of several
  minutes will often contain one organic brand mention, which is not evidence
  of an ad read; a real read names its advertiser at least twice, the same bar
  pattern learning already applies.
- A feed's description is shown in full on its detail page instead of being
  clipped to three lines.
- Links in feed and episode descriptions are clickable. Descriptions were
  flattened to plain text, which dropped the target of a link whose text is a
  name rather than a URL, and left bare URLs unclickable. Both now render as
  links, opening in a new tab. Only absolute http, https, and mailto targets are
  followed, so a javascript: or data: link in a publisher's feed stays inert
  text, and a relative link that would resolve against MinusPod's own address
  is left as plain text. Descriptions are rebuilt as page elements rather than
  injected as markup, so nothing in a feed can inject content into the page.
- Paragraphs and list items in an episode description no longer run together.
  Flattening the markup concatenated them, so the end of one paragraph
  collided with the start of the next. Table cells are separated too.
- Dependency updates, rolled in from the ten open Dependabot pull requests
  rather than merged one at a time. Python: anthropic 0.117.0 to 0.120.0,
  openai 2.46.0 to 2.48.0. Frontend: recharts 3.9.2 to 3.10.1, swagger-ui-dist
  5.32.8 to 5.32.11, wavesurfer.js 7.12.7 to 7.12.11, react-is 19.2.7 to
  19.2.8, eslint 10.7.0 to 10.8.0. Actions: checkout 7.0.0 to 7.0.1,
  setup-python 6.3.0 to 7.0.0, docker/login-action 4.4.0 to 4.5.1. The five
  npm bumps share a lockfile, so they were applied as one relock instead of
  five conflicting cherry-picks.

### Fixed

- The per-feed ad length override was stored, echoed back by the API and
  documented, but never applied. The pipeline built its validator without the
  feed's id, so every stage silently read the global setting instead. Raising
  the limit on a show with long ad blocks did nothing until now. The per-feed
  floor is 30 seconds, matching the global setting; a one-second value would
  have held every ad on the feed. It is also checked against the global hard
  ceiling, since a higher value would be clamped back and the feed would show a
  number it never uses.
- `sponsor` doubled as "no stage classified this", which made a real sponsor
  read indistinguishable from a marker nobody looked at. It is why an episode
  could show four sponsor markers while the detection pass had reported five
  different categories. An unset category, or one outside the vocabulary, is
  now left unset and shows as Uncategorized in the UI, on episode markers and
  on patterns alike, including the patterns that predate the category column.
  Cutting is unchanged:
  resolving a per-category action still reads an unknown category as sponsor,
  which is the conservative choice.
- Two detection stages built markers with no category at all and leaned on
  that default. A dynamically inserted block and a foreign-language ad block
  are paid ads by definition, so both now say so at the point of detection
  rather than inheriting it downstream. Cue-pair markers stay uncategorized,
  which is the honest answer for a stage that only matches audio cues.
- The verification pass could only return four of the seven segment
  categories, so pass 2 could never produce `intro`, `outro` or `recap` even
  though Settings exposes a per-category action for each.
- A merged marker took the category of whichever member happened to sort
  first. One episode detected a sponsor read, a self-promo and a cross-promo
  and labelled all four surviving markers "sponsor". The label now goes to the
  member that classified the most audio, counting only the audio that member
  actually covered, and a member naming nothing, or naming something outside
  the vocabulary, never displaces one that named a real category.
- A verification-pass ad reported its category as the sponsor name, so the
  logs read `Rejecting verification miss for 'self_promo'` and pattern
  learning was handed a sponsor literally named after the category. The
  sponsor scan falls back to any short string field that is not structural,
  and while `type` and `classification` were on that exclusion list,
  `category` was not. The two gates downstream rejected these on their own
  merits, so no bad pattern was learned.
- Auto-created patterns from a verification miss were gated on the advertiser
  brand appearing at least twice in the window. A self-promo or interaction
  segment has no advertiser brand to repeat, so the check rejected them for a
  reason that never applied to them. It now runs only for sponsor reads.
- The window-continuation note the prompt asks the model for ("continues in
  next") reached the sponsor slot, and a note with anything after the phrase
  still did: the phrase was stripped and whatever followed was kept, so
  "continues in next window" became a sponsor named "window". A value that
  opens with a continuation note is refused outright.
- A marker could be left saying only its sponsor name, and a long ad with that
  shape was dropped outright. The name is both a prefix of its own description
  and a full word subset of it, so the duplicate check discarded the
  description that explained the read. The evidence gate then found nothing in
  the bare name and rejected the ad. A description that opens with the sponsor
  name no longer repeats it either, so a marker reads "Acme: ad for listeners"
  rather than "Acme: Acme ad for listeners". The gate also now recognizes the
  pluralized field name the model sometimes uses for the sponsor.
- Prompt improvements never reached an existing install. Seeding inserted each
  prompt row once and never touched it again, while the row stayed flagged as a
  default, so an install kept whatever prompt shipped when its database was
  created. The refresh runs on every boot: the seeding path it would naturally
  belong to returns early on any database that already has feeds in it, which
  is every install that needs this. An install can be running an
  8442-character system prompt with no category section against a shipped
  default of 10408 that requires a category on every ad, which is why
  per-category actions never applied there. A row still flagged as a default
  now tracks the shipped text at startup; a prompt you edited is yours and is
  left alone.
- A self-promo or listener-support read has no advertiser, so the show's own
  name ended up in the sponsor slot, and from there in pattern learning and
  same-sponsor merging. It is rejected there now, matched with separators
  stripped so a run-together rendering still counts. Only an exact match is
  refused, so a brand that merely contains the show's name survives.
- A segment category was only read from a field named exactly "category",
  while start, end and the sponsor name are all matched however the model
  spells them. Only Anthropic enforces the schema, so elsewhere the model
  names fields freely, and a valid category sitting in "type", or spelled out
  as "self-promotion", was dropped. It is now found wherever it appears and
  validated against the vocabulary, so an is-it-an-ad flag of "ad" or a
  position word like "pre-roll" still counts for nothing. A value outside the
  vocabulary now counts as missing rather than passing through, which also
  lets the repair pass have a go at it.
- Per-category actions were not applying, because the categories never
  arrived. Only Anthropic enforces the category list on the model; on every
  other provider the follow-up call that fills in a missing category can answer
  in a shape the parser dropped, and a dropped entry looks the same as a model
  with no opinion. On one episode it resolved 0 of 10, every window, and all of
  them defaulted to sponsor. Case, hyphen and spacing variants of a real
  category are accepted now ("Cross-Promo"), as is a quoted index, and anything
  still unusable is logged with what came back. A position word like "pre-roll"
  is still refused: it says where a segment is, not what it is.
- A stretch of ordinary conversation could be flagged as an ad on the strength
  of a seam. The verification pass reads the already-cut audio, so a pass-1 cut
  leaves a mid-sentence break that looks like a removed ad. The model reported
  one and said plainly that no promotional copy was present, but that phrasing
  was missing from the set of reasons that mean "not an ad", so a 17-second
  piece of an advice segment was held for review. A real read described as
  having no promo code is still kept: the guard needs a content noun.
- A whole ad break could be dropped for being long. An ad over five minutes is
  rejected unless its sponsor is confirmed, and the only thing that counted as
  confirmation was the episode description, which many shows do not use for
  sponsors. A 374-second break naming two sponsors from the registry was
  rejected as too long, and the verification pass, which found the same break
  independently and named all four advertisers in it, could not rescue it. The
  ad's own audio counts as evidence now; the transcript is what is read, not
  the detector's description of it.
- Restoring full ad descriptions stopped the detector learning patterns from
  them. A description that mentions the transcript in passing ("overlapping
  timestamps in transcript") was classified as model reasoning rather than an
  ad description, and the pattern was discarded. That test now only
  decides for text short enough to be reasoning; a reasoning-shaped opening
  still decides at any length.
- A word beginning with "ad" was read as the start of an advertisement, so
  "mailing address" stored "mailing" as the sponsor.
- An uploaded replacement now survives a redeploy and applies without a
  restart. Two things stood in the way. `assets/` is copied into the image by
  the Dockerfile and is only a bind mount if the operator uncomments it, so
  anything written there is lost on the next pull; uploads go to the data
  volume instead. And the path was resolved once at import into a module
  constant, so a swapped file kept rendering the old sound until the container
  restarted. It is resolved per call now, and the duration used to place
  chapters and cues reads the same path the renderer does, so the two cannot
  disagree.
- Replacement audio uploads are restricted to the formats the page advertises.
  ffmpeg decodes far more than those five, including playlist containers that
  point at other files on the server, and a container is now checked before
  anything is transcoded. Removing the current upload while a render is running
  no longer fails that render: it falls back to the shipped sound.
- A podping sent while the container was restarting was lost. The listener
  resumed at the chain head, and a podping is never resent, so every deploy
  left a gap. It now records the last block it read and resumes there, still
  skipping a catch-up wider than the existing cap, and writes its position on
  shutdown rather than only on the flush cadence.
- The Podping listener never acted on a single notification. It only accepted
  senders reachable from the `podping` account's posting authorities, but all
  live traffic comes from `podping.aaa` through `podping.eee`, which have their
  own keys and appear in no account's authority list. Every real podping was
  dropped, silently, since the listener shipped in 2.77.1. Measuring 25
  consecutive Hive blocks found 41 podpings and all 41 were rejected. The
  reference watcher had already abandoned this check; MinusPod now does the
  same and filters on the operation id. An operation signed with active
  authority rather than posting authority is accepted as well.
- The host coverage table ignored any notification whose reason the listener
  does not act on, so a sender using one would have been invisible. Hosts are
  counted from all traffic; only the feed refresh is gated on the reason. The
  table is bounded, since anyone can podping any address: a single flush adds
  at most 500 domains and the table keeps the 10,000 most recently seen.
- The listener wrote more than it needed to. It stamped the last-ping time on
  every matching notification rather than once per cooldown, rewrote its block
  position every three seconds once the host buffer went quiet, reloaded every
  feed's episode counts once a minute to read two columns, and re-read one
  already-processed block on a restart that was already caught up.
- A feed's `<podcast:podping>` declaration was never read in steady state. The
  tag is parsed from the feed body, but a refresh that gets a 304 has no body
  and returns early, and most refreshes are 304s because a feed's RSS rarely
  changes. So the declaration stayed unread until a feed happened to publish,
  which left the per-feed `hiveAccount` authorization inert on every existing
  feed. A 304 now forces one full fetch when the declaration has never been
  read, the same way a missing cached artwork already does, and records it on
  the first fetch that succeeds.
- The tail re-transcription failed on the local Whisper backend for any span
  of 30 seconds or more. When a quiet post-roll falls outside Whisper's VAD the
  transcript ends early, and the pass that re-reads that tail with VAD off
  failed with "No clip timestamps found", because the batched pipeline builds
  its chunks from VAD output and had none. Shorter tails used faster-whisper's
  own single-clip fallback and were unaffected. The no-VAD path now supplies
  its own 30 second clips covering the whole span, measured against the file
  actually transcribed, so a quiet tail gets transcribed and reviewed instead
  of reaching the detector with no text.
- A failed tail re-transcription logged the same line as a tail that held no
  speech, so the failure only showed up if you grepped for the transcriber's
  own error. The two now log differently.
- An episode row left in 'processing' by a killed worker only healed on the
  next restart. The queue drainer's waiter polled the row's status alone, so it
  sat on a job nothing was running for the full hard timeout, two hours by
  default, then requeued and waited again. It now notices that no worker holds
  the processing lock and requeues straight away. The reconciler that resets
  those rows also runs on the drainer's periodic sweep, not only at startup,
  and skips any episode that currently holds the lock, so a slow transcription
  is not mistaken for a crash. A run that finishes clears the crash message an
  earlier sweep left on the row.
- Cancelling an episode marked its queue row failed, and the retry ladder then
  re-ran the episode the user had just cancelled. A cancel closes the queue row
  now.
- A reprocess that auto-approved a held marker completed twice, writing two
  history rows and sending two notifications for one action. The second row
  carried no detection stats, because a recut does no detection. The pipeline
  finalized the run, then approved the holds and recut, and the recut finalized
  again. Approvals are now filed before the run finalizes and applied by the
  run's own recut, so one reprocess is one completion carrying the
  post-approval numbers. If that recut fails, the run still finalizes the audio
  it already rendered rather than discarding it and reporting a failure.
- An episode a listener asked for while the worker was busy was never
  processed. The just-in-time path recorded it only in the status file the UI
  reads, which nothing drains, so "queued at position 1" was display only and
  the episode depended on the client retrying at a moment the worker was free.
  It now goes on the work queue the background drainer reads. A play request is
  also marked user-requested, without which the drainer discards it on feeds
  with auto-processing turned off. A client polling that request every minute
  no longer resets the queue's retry count on each poll.
- Importing the app started the RSS refresh, queue processor and podping
  listener, which under test ran against the test database and made results
  depend on which module started first. They are not started under pytest.
- The no-parser fallback for rendering descriptions stripped tags in a single
  pass, which leaves a live tag for input like `<scr<script>ipt>`. It reuses
  the shared helper that strips until the text stops changing. Flagged by
  CodeQL; the text was already escaped by React, so nothing was injectable.
- Short pattern phrases matched arbitrary conversation. Fuzzy matching scores
  the best substring alignment, so a 20-character phrase of common words
  clears the flat threshold somewhere in any long transcript. One episode held
  four sponsors on ordinary speech that way, a 22-character outro landing on
  "feel. you know, you do" and a 21-character one on "what is your website?".
  The score a phrase must reach now rises as the phrase gets shorter, so a
  short one has to be near-verbatim, and a variant under 20 characters is not
  matched at all: an exact substring scores full marks whatever the threshold.
  All four measured false positives fall below the new bar; the genuine match
  in the same episode, a 156-character phrase, still matches. All four came
  from community patterns, whose variants are stored verbatim, so a length
  floor at learning time would not catch them: locally learned variants
  already require 20 words for an intro, 15 for an outro.
- A pattern match is timed against the words it aligned to rather than the
  start of the block it was found in, which was placing matches off the ad.
- A held pattern marker named only its sponsor and pattern id, which left a
  reviewer no way to judge it. The marker now quotes the transcript text the
  pattern matched, with the score: `Acme (pattern #12, outro "for a free trial
  at acme dot com" 86%)`.
- A back-to-back ad break made the model answer with a list of sponsors, which
  was stored as its Python repr, so a marker read `['Acme', "Bob's Diner"]` and
  anything downstream that split on the quotes recovered fragments like
  "s Diner". Several names are joined into one readable label instead. Other
  text fields are flattened the same way; a list in `end_text` used to raise.
- A play request for an episode with no database row yet lost its
  user-requested stamp, because the insert path did not carry the column the
  update path did. The drainer then discarded the queued row on a feed with
  auto-processing off.
- A host's own site named inside a sponsor read ("the home of my website,
  example.com") was harvested as a sponsor. Every break on that show then
  shared the token, which merged unrelated ads together. Domain labels formed
  from the show's own name are no longer treated as advertisers.
- Ad marker text was cut off with no way to read the rest, most visibly on
  mobile (#591). Two things caused it. The detector cut its own description to
  300 characters, and to 150 when combining it with a sponsor name, so the
  stored text already ended in a literal "..." with nothing behind it. In a
  sample of recent episodes, 40 of 190 reasons were cut this way. The UI also
  had no way to show a long reason in full. The detector now keeps the text
  whole, and long reasons and reviewer notes clamp to a few lines with a
  control to see the rest. Markers detected before this release keep whatever
  text was stored for them; only a reprocess recovers the full wording.
- The three ad-length fields in Settings rejected any keystroke that left the
  value below the floor, so selecting "300" and typing "120" reverted the field
  on the first digit and mangled the rest of the entry. They accept a typed
  value and clamp it when you leave the field.
- The community-sync settings page returned 500 when any synced pattern had
  no category. The per-category breakdown used the value as a dict key, and
  its `.get` default never applied, because the key was present and null
  rather than absent. Uncategorized patterns count as sponsor there, matching
  how sync itself filters on category. Underneath it, an unset category had
  two representations: markers dropped the key while pattern rows kept it as
  null, and the null form silently defeats any consumer written with a `.get`
  default. Pattern rows now drop the key too, so unset means absent
  everywhere, including in the patterns API where the field was already
  optional.
- A malformed feed body and the gzip retry that preceded it were logged
  without naming the feed, so a recurring pair could not be tied to one
  origin. Both lines carry the feed now, and the parse warning reports the
  body size with it.
- A sponsor named at the front of the detector's reason text was missed when
  the read was described further along, as in "Acme pest control sponsor
  read". The patterns wanted the brand within two words of that phrase. A name
  written as a slash-joined pair, "Acme/Acme Co", never matched at all, since
  none of them could cross a slash. A leading brand is now read as a last
  resort, and a slash pair reduces to its first form.
- A break that named its advertisers after a colon ("Ad break with three
  reads: Acme, Bravo, and Delta") matched no pattern, so the ad-evidence gate
  saw no sponsor and dropped the break as content. One 158-second break with
  three real advertisers went that way. The first advertiser named is now the
  label, and the rest stay in the reason text. A hyphenated compound before
  the word "sponsor" also captured a fragment, storing "read" as the
  advertiser for "host-read sponsor spots".

  Underneath those symptoms, sponsor names were pulled out of the reason by
  matching sentence structure, and the model rewords the reason on every run,
  so each pattern only ever covered the phrasing it was written for. Measured
  against a corpus of real detector output, that approach got 7 of 18 right.
  A brand is now found by its shape and confirmed by any domain named in the
  same text, which is the signal that survives rewording: "Jack Archer Jet
  Setter Tech Pant" resolves to Jack Archer because JackArcher.com agrees
  with it. The same corpus now scores 18 of 18 and ships as a test, so the
  next change to extraction is measured against variance rather than one
  example. A break naming several advertisers is labelled by the first one,
  rather than by whichever happened to have a URL beside it, and a name that
  no domain confirms is capped so the label stops at the brand instead of
  running on through the product description.
- The bar chart tooltip on the stats page was unreadable and its hover
  highlight looked like a second bar (#592). The value line kept the charting
  library's dark default text on a dark card, and no hover cursor was set, so
  the default light grey rect showed through at full strength. The tooltip now
  takes the card's foreground colour and the cursor is the same subtle
  theme-tinted fill the per-feed distribution chart already used.
- A pattern id in marker text linked to the wrong place when the text held
  more than one.
- The play button on a kept segment announced itself as "Play this ad" to a
  screen reader, on rows the section describes as content kept on purpose.
- The LLM benchmark now measures whether a model names a segment category, and
  no longer penalizes the ones that do. "category" was absent from both the
  required and the known-optional key sets, so a model omitting it was counted
  as missing nothing while a model emitting it took an extra-key violation. It
  resolves the category the same way the live parser does, and the report says
  which resolver scored the run, since an environment that cannot import the
  app falls back to a simpler check.
- The Podping host coverage list in the Podcasting 2.0 docs was stale and
  incomplete. It named seven hosts; measuring three days of Podping traffic
  on the Hive chain found thirteen, including PodServe, which sends more
  notifications than Transistor. The list is now marked as a snapshot rather
  than a fixed set, since hosts adopt Podping over time (#579).

## [2.79.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Community pattern categories are visible and controllable. Patterns show
  their segment category in the patterns list and API, the community
  settings section breaks down how many synced patterns fall in each
  category, and checkboxes there choose which categories to accept.
  Unchecking one deactivates its already-synced community patterns rather
  than deleting them, and re-checking restores them on the next sync.
  Locally created patterns are never touched. All seven categories are
  accepted by default, so syncing behaves as before until changed.
- Chapter generation receives the detected ad and segment positions as
  boundary hints. Ads usually sit between show segments, so the seam where
  one was cut is a likely topic change; the model treats these as candidate
  boundaries and still needs the transcript to support a real change.
  Feeds whose chapters come from the publisher or an embedded track are
  unaffected.

## [2.78.7] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- The Detection and Chapters dropdowns on the feed settings page size to
  their content like the dropdowns above and below them. They sat in a
  column layout that stretched them to the panel width, and the earlier
  attempt only capped that stretch instead of stopping it.

- Documentation now states plainly that segment categories are configured
  per feed, that intro, outro, and recap are only detected when a feed
  opts in, and that an existing prompt override forcing intro or outro
  removal should be removed.

## [2.78.6] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed


- Anthropic responses that begin with a thinking block no longer fail to
  parse. The reader took the first content block and asked for its text;
  with extended thinking that block has none, so verification windows and
  chapter calls failed with "'ThinkingBlock' object has no attribute
  'text'". It now takes the first text block and skips thinking blocks,
  matching how the tool-use path already reads responses.
- A single chapter produced by topic detection that returned nothing
  usable is now flagged as degraded. Detection that fails outright was
  already caught; a response that parses to zero boundaries was not, so a
  90-minute episode could ship one chapter and look finished.

## [2.78.5] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Chapter generation no longer produces a single whole-episode chapter when
  the model rejects the temperature parameter. Opus 5 joins the list of
  models that never receive it, and the retry after a rejection now omits
  the parameter instead of resending a default value, which could never
  succeed. A rejection is also remembered for the rest of the run, so a
  model MinusPod has not seen before costs one failed call rather than
  every call. Chapter degradation is recorded in the run's processing
  stats and logged, instead of passing silently as a finished episode.
- The app version is resolved through a path-independent accessor. A
  module-level import of the root version file crashed every worker at
  boot in 2.78.4, because the container puts only the source directory on
  the import path. A new test imports the boot-path modules under
  container-equivalent conditions so this class of failure fails in CI,
  and the release flow documents a container smoke check before push.
- Regenerating chapters shows progress and a result. The control sits in a
  menu that closes on click, so the pending state was never visible and
  neither success nor failure was reported.

### Added

- A "Do not send temperature" toggle beside the stage temperature controls
  (`omitTemperature`), for models that reject the parameter outright. The
  per-stage temperature inputs grey out while it is on.

## [2.78.4] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- The processing history table shows which MinusPod version processed
  each run, so a run's results can be tied to the code that produced it.
  Rows recorded before this release show a dash.

## [2.78.3] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Kept segments now appear in their own Kept segments section on the
  episode page. They were being listed as rejected detections, which read
  as though the keep setting had failed.

## [2.78.2] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- Detection now repairs missing segment categories with a follow-up call.
  When a feed uses per-category actions (or has show-segments detection on)
  and the LLM leaves one or more found segments without a category, a
  second call asks only for those categories before they default to
  sponsor. It runs at most once per affected window, and never runs for a
  feed on default (remove-everything) actions.

- Categorized segments now survive the stages that run before the
  action-gated merge. Window-level deduplication and the pattern-coverage
  drop both discarded a detection's category, so an intro or outro set to
  keep could be folded into an adjacent sponsor cut and removed anyway.
  Both stages now respect the feed's per-category actions, and a span
  fully contained inside a conflicting one is split around rather than
  collapsed.

- Feed settings: shorter labels on the show-segment toggle and the
  re-render button, with the detail moved to helper text, so neither
  wraps into a slab on narrow screens.

## [2.78.1] - 2026-07-24

### Changed

- The webhook reference now documents the Feed Refresh Failed event:
  when it fires (3 consecutive upstream fetch failures), its payload
  variables, and a default payload example. The event is not new; only
  the docs were missing it.

- Feed settings panel: the Detection and Chapters selects no longer stretch
  to the panel's full width, each segment-category row in the actions
  matrix (feed and global) now shows a muted one-line description of what
  the category covers, and the show-segments, source feed, detection mode,
  and chapters helper text is clearer.

- The webhook test button now sends one sample payload per subscribed event
  type instead of always sending an Episode Processed sample.

- Detection prompt: "category" is now required right next to the JSON schema
  line, not only in a later block, with a non-sponsor worked example and a
  matching category example inside the show-segments section. When a feed
  with non-default segment actions or show-segments detection enabled still
  gets category-less LLM responses, the detector now logs one warning per
  run naming the feed and the count affected, since those responses silently
  default to sponsor and can skip the feed's configured actions.

## [2.78.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Segment categories: every detected marker now carries a category (sponsor,
  cross_promo, self_promo, interaction, and opt-in intro, outro, recap) and
  each category resolves to an action (remove, beep, keep). Resolution
  checks a per-feed override first, then the global default, then falls
  back to remove. Configure the global map at Settings > Global Defaults >
  "Segment actions", and per-feed overrides on the feed settings page under
  the same heading, where each category starts inherited from the global
  map until touched. Every category defaults to remove, so existing feeds
  cut exactly as before until an action is changed. A kept marker stays in
  the audio, bypasses validator holds and reviewer boundary checks, is
  dropped instead of re-flagged when pass-2 verification finds it again,
  and is excluded from the "Detections Not Cut" count, while still teaching
  the pattern learner its category. Opt a feed into intro/outro/recap
  detection with the "Detect intro, outro, and housekeeping segments"
  toggle on its settings page, off by default; the other four categories
  are always detected. A "Re-render episodes with current segment actions"
  button on the feed settings page recuts a feed's already-processed
  episodes against the current action maps. See [How It Works > Segment
  Categories](docs/how-it-works.md#segment-categories) and [Configuration >
  Segment Categories](docs/configuration.md#segment-categories) (#565).

### Fixed

- Both the GPU and CPU images' `org.opencontainers.image.version` OCI label
  now reflects the running MinusPod version instead of inheriting `26.04`
  from the `ubuntu:26.04` base image (#576).
- react-router-dom was retired upstream; we now depend on react-router v8
  directly, fixing GHSA-qwww-vcr4-c8h2. The temporary npm audit allowlist is
  removed (#578).

## [2.77.1] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Expand all / collapse all controls on the Settings page, next to settings
  search, to open or close every settings card at once (#575).

### Changed

- The Podping toggle now lives in Settings > Global Defaults, directly under
  the feed refresh interval, and the "Podcasting 2.0" settings section is
  titled "Transcripts & Chapters" again.

## [2.77.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Opt-in Podping listener: a leader-only background thread polls public Hive
  API nodes roughly every 3 seconds for Podping publish notifications and
  refreshes a matching feed immediately, instead of waiting for the next
  scheduled RSS poll. Off by default (`podpingEnabled`, Settings >
  Podcasting 2.0). No Hive account or keys are needed; the sender
  allow-list comes from the `podping` account's posting authorities, fetched
  hourly, and is fail-closed until the first successful fetch. A feed more
  than 100 blocks behind (startup, node outage) skips straight to the chain
  head rather than replaying; regular polling remains the completeness
  fallback, so a missed or delayed notification costs nothing. Matched
  refreshes are throttled to once per feed per 300 seconds. Coverage depends
  on the host: Buzzsprout, Transistor, RSS.com, Spreaker, Captivate,
  RedCircle, and Fireside send Podping notifications today; many large hosts,
  including Acast, Megaphone, Libsyn, Simplecast, and Omny, do not. See
  [Podcasting 2.0 > Podping](docs/podcasting-2.0.md#podping).
- Feed refresh interval is now a setting (`rssRefreshIntervalMinutes`,
  Settings > Global Defaults; default 15 minutes, range 5-1440), replacing
  the previous hardcoded 900-second background RSS poll. A change applies
  after the wait already in progress finishes.
- Feeds expose a `lastPodpingAt` timestamp, stamped whenever the Podping
  listener matches the feed, and the feed detail page shows a "Last
  podping" line once one has been received. This is the diagnostic for
  whether a host sends Podping notifications and whether MinusPod's stored
  source URL matches what the host announces.

### Changed

- Release notes now roll up every CHANGELOG.md section shipped since the
  previous tagged release into the GitHub pre-release, instead of only the
  one section matching the version being tagged. Covers the case where a PR
  bumps the version more than once before merging, so nothing ships
  undocumented.

## [2.76.1] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- The update panel in Settings shows the release channel next to the
  running version ("Running 2.76.1 (edge)") and tucks the channel
  selector, daily-check toggle, check button, and changelog link behind
  an "Update settings" disclosure, collapsed by default.

## [2.76.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Six ad-detection tunables in Settings > Ad Detection: a verification-pass
  miss hold floor (default 0.60) and autocut threshold (off by default),
  pattern-learning confidence floors for short and long ads (default 0.85 /
  0.92), and a differential correlation ceiling (default 0.60) plus a
  differential hold minimum length (default 10s, 0 disables it). See
  [Configuration > Detection Tuning](docs/configuration.md#detection-tuning).
- Standalone pass-2 verification misses (ads pass 2 finds that overlap no
  pass-1 marker) are no longer silently discarded. They now hold for review
  with hold reason `verification_miss` (a "Verification catch" chip in Held
  for Review) once they clear the new hold floor, or cut automatically when
  the opt-in autocut floor is enabled and cleared. Below both floors the
  miss is still dropped, but the drop is now logged with the sponsor,
  confidence, and floor it fell short of.
- Cue fusion joins the cross-fetch differential stage on feeds with cue
  templates configured. A matched template cue on either edge of an
  otherwise-uncorroborated differential candidate now corroborates it (cuts
  instead of holding), a candidate bracketed by a break-start/break-end cue
  pair corroborates the same way, and the refetch is scanned for the same
  cues as the primary download so a shared cue re-anchors the comparison
  timeline against fetch-to-fetch drift. Cross-fetch differential detection
  is now significantly more accurate on cue-templated feeds; see [Audio Cue
  Detection](docs/audio-cues.md) and [How It Works > Cross-Fetch
  Differential](docs/how-it-works.md#cross-fetch-differential).
- Episode Processed webhooks and emails now carry `ads_held` and
  `ads_not_cut` counts (`episode.ads_held` / `episode.ads_not_cut` template
  fields); the email adds an "Ads held for review" and/or "Detections not
  cut" row only when either is nonzero.

### Changed

- The cross-fetch differential stage now measures rather than assumes:
  every silence-delimited block in the run file is probed against the
  refetch and carries its own measured correlation, replacing the previous
  hard-coded 0.0 for unprobed gaps. A region only becomes a differential
  candidate when its measured correlation is at or below the new
  correlation-ceiling setting, and a candidate close to the boundary gets
  one retry with a widened search window before being judged. Old stored
  differentials (which hard-coded corr 0.0) still qualify, so recuts of
  previously-processed episodes behave the same as before.
- An uncorroborated differential candidate shorter than the new
  hold-minimum-length setting is dropped instead of held for review;
  corroborated candidates are unaffected regardless of length.
- Rejecting a differential detection, held or not, still blocks that same
  episode-region from resurfacing, but no longer creates cross-episode
  false-positive text: previously, rejecting one of these could
  suppress legitimate future matches feed-wide, since the detection was
  never a confirmed false positive from a real detector. A one-time
  startup backfill deactivates existing cross-episode false-positive text
  traceable to a differential rejection (episodes with an ambiguous id
  are skipped rather than guessed at); nothing is deleted. Corrections
  now also carry a `source_hold_reason` field recording which hold
  reason, if any, produced them.

### Fixed

- Sponsor labels no longer pick up LLM reasoning prose or a bare "...
  segment" name instead of the actual advertiser; a sanitizer strips both
  before a label reaches a marker. Two accepted markers describing the same
  ad read that overlap by 80% or more of the shorter span's duration now
  merge into one marker spanning their union, instead of showing up as
  separate, duplicate detections.
- `AdDetector.learn_from_detections` now initializes its dependencies on a
  cold detector, matching its three sibling methods; previously a cold
  detector (one that had not yet processed anything) silently no-opped
  instead of learning from the detection it was given.
- SMTP send failures now log the full exception traceback instead of just
  the message, for easier troubleshooting from container logs (issue
  #571).
- The startup banner's ASCII art no longer gets dropped by journald-backed
  log drivers (podman): the banner record now starts on its first art line
  instead of a leading blank line, which some drivers treat as an empty
  record and discard (issue #567 discussion).

## [2.75.0] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- The first episode processed after a container start silently skipped
  the fingerprint and text-pattern detection stages, so known-sponsor
  ads with existing patterns went uncut whenever an episode was the
  first to reach detection in a fresh process (frequent lately given
  the release cadence: every deploy restarts the container). The stage
  gates checked matcher objects that are only built later in the run,
  at stage 3, which also explains why reprocessing the same episode
  minutes later would detect normally. Dependencies are now built at
  the start of every detection run, before the stage gates.

### Added

- Startup now logs the MinusPod logo as an ASCII banner (waveform,
  strikethrough, and wordmark) with the running version and repo link
  under it, so the version is easy to spot when scrolling container
  logs (suggested in issue #567's discussion). The plain
  "MinusPod vX.Y.Z starting..." line is unchanged for log queries.

## [2.74.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- In-app update checks (issue #567). Settings > System Status shows the
  running version's release date, a channel picker (stable or edge), a
  daily auto-check toggle, a Check for updates button, and a changelog
  link. A dismissible banner appears under the top bar when a newer
  release is available on the selected channel. The daily check can also
  send the new Update Available webhook and email notification, once per
  version. Backed by GET /api/v1/system/updates (GitHub Releases,
  cached 6 hours) and GET/PUT /api/v1/settings/update-check.
- The latest and cpu Docker tags now move automatically when a release
  is published (release-tags workflow). The stable and stable-cpu tags
  still move only when a soaked release is promoted.

## [2.73.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Formal release channels. Every release is now git-tagged and published
  as a GitHub pre-release with its changelog section as notes
  (scripts/publish_release.sh). Soaked releases are promoted to stable
  (scripts/promote_release.sh), which moves the new :stable and
  :stable-cpu Docker tags without rebuilding. docs/releasing.md
  documents the flow and the Breaking changelog convention (issue #567
  groundwork).

## [2.72.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Held for Review and Detections Not Cut rows can open in the waveform
  editor (issue #563). A pencil button next to each row's play button opens
  the same scrub-and-drag editor the Detected Ads list uses, playing the
  original audio. Confirming with moved boundaries files a trimmed confirm,
  so only the span inside the pins is cut; the plain confirm and Not an ad
  actions match the row buttons, including the one-tap recut when a held
  confirm completes the review set.

## [2.71.0] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- Deleting a sponsor with linked patterns could leak an open write transaction
  when the unlink UPDATE hit a busy database, freezing every later write on
  that worker thread ("database is locked" at 0ms) until a container restart,
  while reads and the health check stayed green (issue #566). The delete now
  runs in an immediate transaction, so the write lock is taken up front where
  busy_timeout applies, and rolls back on failure. A new request teardown hook
  also rolls back any transaction a request leaves open, so no other write
  path can wedge its thread's connection this way. The background refresh
  loop, queue processor, and episode processing thread got the same guard,
  plus explicit rollbacks at four write sites that logged and swallowed
  failures without cleaning up (queueing an episode, search indexing,
  reviewer audit log).

## [2.70.0] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Manual pattern creation (confirm, adjust, and create corrections) now runs the
  ad text through the same multi-sponsor split as the pattern-split tool before
  writing to the database. These paths previously called create_ad_pattern
  directly and skipped its guards, so a contaminated read spanning several
  sponsors (the reporter's 3505-character example in issue #563) became one
  oversized pattern instead of one per sponsor.
- Splitting a pattern at overlapping ad-transition phrases (e.g. "brought to you
  by" nested inside "this episode is brought to you by") no longer drops the
  shared prefix into a spurious tiny segment; the split now dedupes to a single
  point and keeps the full leading phrase with its segment.
- Reopening the ad editor now starts on the first ad. The selected-ad index
  survived closing the editor, so a second Edit Ads session resumed on the
  last ad worked on and made the earlier ones look gone until you left the
  episode page entirely (issue #564).

### Added

- Split button on the pattern detail view for active patterns, calling the
  existing split endpoint and showing the API's error text inline if the
  pattern has no split points.
- Correction responses for the create type now include `patternIds`, listing
  every pattern created or reused when the submitted text auto-split into
  several sponsor segments.

## [2.69.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Auto chapter mode now also fetches a feed's separate podcast:chapters JSON
  file when the embedded chapter probe comes up short, remaps its timestamps
  onto the cut audio, and preserves it the same way as embedded chapters. A
  fetch failure falls back to generated chapters instead of skipping the
  chapter step.

## [2.68.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Detected ads on the episode page now have the same inline play button
  the held and rejected rows have, so a cut span can be auditioned from
  the retained original audio without opening the editor.

## [2.67.1] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- Bumped the frontend's transitive fast-uri dependency past advisory
  GHSA-4c8g-83qw-93j6. Build tooling only (service worker generation);
  the runtime bundle never included it.

## [2.67.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- Per-feed chapter mode (Feed Settings > Chapters): Auto, Always
  generate, or Off (Off applies to episodes processed after the
  switch; earlier episodes keep their existing chapters until
  reprocessed). Auto, the default, preserves the podcast's own
  embedded chapters, remapped onto the ad-free timeline, and falls
  back to generated chapters only when fewer than two of the
  publisher's own chapters survive the cut (issue #560). Previously
  MinusPod always generated its own chapters and discarded the
  publisher's, even when they were accurate and only needed their
  timestamps shifted. A failed chapter probe (for example a transient
  ffprobe error) is no longer treated as "no chapters": it is now
  distinguished from a genuinely chapterless file, and the chapter
  step is skipped for that run instead of falling through to generate
  and overwriting the ID3 frames the cut step already wrote correctly.

### Fixed

- Pass-2 auto-approval now also releases a contradiction hold when the
  pass-2 detection agrees with the reviewer's own proposed sub-span
  trim, not only when it covers most of the padded hold as before.
  Agreement is measured by IoU (0.8 or higher) between the pass-2 ad
  and the reviewer's proposed sub-span. Either way, the auto-filed
  confirm is trimmed to the agreed sub-span, so hold padding neither
  side attested is never cut on the detection's authority.

### Documentation

- The OpenVINO transcription sidecar's example compose file now runs
  as the image's built-in `ovms` user instead of root (issue #558).

## [2.66.1] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- Pass-2 auto-approval no longer demands the corroborating detection cover
  90 percent of the held span. Differential hold tails carry alignment
  padding the detection rightly excludes: a 240 second ZocDoc break on
  tosh-show scored 89.9 percent coverage, missed the bar by 0.3 seconds,
  and shipped audible after a reprocess. The bar drops to 75 percent, and
  in exchange the auto-filed confirm is trimmed to the sub-span pass 2
  actually attested (the same shape a human trimmed approval files), so
  the uncovered padding is never cut on the detection's authority. The
  recut clamps to the attested span through the existing confirmed_span
  path.
- The validator's close-gap merge no longer folds a held marker into an
  adjacent non-held ad (any hold reason, generalizing the existing
  held-differential guard). On an auto-approve recut such a fold grew the
  marker past its trimmed confirm, so the confirmed_span clamp never
  fired and trimmed-out audio was cut anyway.

## [2.66.0] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed

- The reviewer contradiction guard no longer holds spans whose reasoning
  affirms they are ads. The guard scanned the whole reasoning for negation
  phrases, so a boundary note like "that interview material is not
  advertising and should be excluded" (about a 28 second tail) held a 231
  second block of three sponsor reads that every detection signal agreed
  on (tosh-show, and the same shape previously on daily-tech-news-show).
  An affirmation paired with trim language now wins, and a confirmed
  verdict whose prose describes a trim gets the trim recovered and applied
  as an adjust instead of a hold. An affirmation with a whole-span
  negation and no trim description (self-promo dismissals like "an ad for
  the show's own merch, which is not advertising") still holds as before.
- Merged ad spans are no longer blanket expand-only in the reviewer. Merge
  sites now record which member spans are transcript-anchored; reviewer
  trims and trim recovery clamp to that protected union, so a trailing
  member ad still cannot be severed (the original Grainger case) while
  the alignment-derived padding of differential regions is trimmable
  again. Markers persisted by earlier releases keep the old blanket rule.
- Pass-2 auto-approval now releases every releasable hold reason
  (reviewer_contradiction, no_splice_evidence, uncorroborated_tail)
  instead of only differential_uncorroborated, so a pass-2 re-detection of
  a held span converges in the same run regardless of why the span was
  held. no_cue_evidence stays excluded: pass-2 ads can never carry cue
  evidence, so releasing those would neutralize cue gating. max_duration
  stays excluded: such a hold is by definition over the duration ceiling,
  and the auto-filed confirm would force-accept it past the validator's
  re-check on recut.

## [2.65.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Podcast search provider option (Settings > Podcast Search): iTunes or
  PodcastIndex.org. iTunes searches Apple's directory with no account or
  API key and is the default for installs that never configured
  PodcastIndex, so name search now works out of the box. An explicit
  choice always wins, and installs that already had PodcastIndex
  credentials keep using PodcastIndex until they pick otherwise. Both
  providers return the same result shape; iTunes entries without an RSS
  feed URL are dropped rather than shown as dead results.

### Fixed
- Episodes with malformed embedded cover art no longer fail transcription
  (issue #556). 2.62.0 folded the FLAC encode into chunk extraction, and
  FLAC can carry embedded pictures, so ffmpeg tried to transcode a
  mislabeled APIC frame (ID3 says PNG, bytes are JPEG) into every chunk
  and aborted the extract. Chunk extraction and audio preprocessing now
  pass -vn to ignore artwork streams entirely.
- ffmpeg failures are diagnosable from logs: instead of the first 200
  characters of stderr (always the version banner), MinusPod now logs the
  error lines, falling back to the tail.
- When chunk extraction is what failed, the episode error says so
  ("Audio chunk extraction failed (ffmpeg could not decode the source
  file)") instead of the generic transcription failure that pointed
  #556's reporter at a healthy Whisper provider. Pass 2 treats extraction
  failure like an outage: verification is skipped, the cut episode is
  kept.

## [2.64.1] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- Two bugs that kept obvious DAI ads stuck in the review queue (found by
  tracing a Daily Tech News Show episode through both a normal run and a
  reprocess):
  - The detection merge decided cut-vs-held by sort order. When a Claude ad
    started fractionally before the differential region it corroborated
    (0.24 seconds in the observed episode), the merge rewrote the marker's
    stage to dai_differential before the corroboration check read it, so
    the check no longer saw a Claude corroborator and re-held a span with
    72 percent transcript coverage and four transcribed sponsor reads. The
    check now reads the corroborator's pre-merge stage.
  - Pass-2 auto-approval treated any confirm that grazed the held span as
    "already on file" and skipped filing its own. After a reprocess, DAI
    timelines shift, so stale confirms from the previous copy routinely
    graze a new hold without covering it; the recut then ran without a
    matching confirm, the validator re-held the marker, and the
    auto-approval reported success while doing nothing. The idempotency
    check now uses the validator's own force-accept criterion (the confirm
    must cover at least half the span), sourced from one shared constant.

## [2.64.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- Test connection buttons for every configured external endpoint (issue
  #544): the remote transcriber, the LLM provider base URL (OpenAI
  Compatible and Ollama), and PodcastIndex. All three share the same staged
  result readout: server unreachable (red), reachable but the request
  failed with a specific reason (amber), or working (green).
- LLM provider connection test: hits the same /models route the real
  client uses for discovery, with the same automatic /v1 suffix for
  Ollama. Unlike the key Test button it works without an API key (local
  Ollama has none) and can test an unsaved base URL. The saved key is sent
  only when the tested URL matches the saved one. Anthropic and OpenRouter
  get the same button against their fixed public endpoints, separating an
  unreachable network from a rejected or missing key.
- PodcastIndex connection test: sends the same signed one-result search
  the Add Feed search uses, so a passing test means search will work.
  Uses saved credentials only; the button is blocked while unsaved drafts
  sit in the form.
- Remote transcriber connection test: next to
  the API Base URL field in Transcription settings, it uploads a one-second
  generated audio sample through the same request shape and upload format
  (FLAC by default, WAV when Skip FLAC compression is on) a real episode
  uses, so the result reflects an actual transcription call rather than a
  bare health check. The result separates the cases that matter when
  setting up a backend like OpenVINO Model Server: server unreachable,
  server alive but no transcription endpoint at that path (OVMS only
  answers under its versioned base such as /v3), endpoint present but
  rejecting the request (wrong model name, missing API key, FLAC upload to
  a server without a FLAC decoder), and a reachable server that is just
  slow to answer (model cold-load), which is reported as such instead of
  as down. Unsaved values can be tested before saving, and a stale result
  clears as soon as any tested field changes. The saved API key is sent
  only when the tested URL points at the same server as the saved base
  URL, so the key cannot be pointed at an arbitrary host. Unlike the
  existing key Test button, it works without an API key and does not
  depend on the /models route many transcription servers never implement.

### Changed
- Dependency bumps via Dependabot: anthropic 0.117.0, openai 2.46.0,
  huggingface-hub 1.24.0, actions/setup-node v7, and frontend dev
  dependencies (typescript-eslint 8.64.0, vite 8.1.5, lucide-react 1.25.0).

## [2.63.2] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- Differential holds that pass 2 independently re-detects as ads are now
  approved automatically instead of waiting in the review queue. The hold
  exists because no independent stage confirmed the span in pass 1 (typically
  a quiet DAI post-roll the original-audio transcript barely covers); a
  second Whisper transcription reading nearly the whole span as a confident
  ad is exactly that missing corroboration. Pending audio is still never cut
  mid-pipeline: the corroborating detection is dropped as before, the hold is
  stamped, and after the episode completes the stamp files the same confirm
  correction the approve button writes and runs the standard recut from the
  retained original audio. Corroboration requires the detection to clear the
  normal cut-confidence bar, overlap exactly one pending marker, sit at least
  half inside the held span, and cover at least 90 percent of it. Guard
  rails: a span the user explicitly rejected is never auto-approved, an
  existing equivalent confirm is not duplicated, the recut only runs when its
  preconditions (retained original audio, saved segments) hold, and it is not
  cancellable so a cancel cannot delete a completed episode's files. All
  other hold reasons and held pass-2 detections behave exactly as before.

## [2.63.1] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- The boundary reviewer now sees per-segment timestamps for the candidate ad
  span instead of timestamp-stripped text, so a proposed trim can land on the
  sentence it names. A warning logs when a trim's number disagrees with the
  seconds figure in its own reasoning. Root cause of a partial preroll ad
  shipping on a DAI feed: the reviewer trimmed a 35 second candidate to 20
  seconds while its reasoning named the sentence ending at 28.4 seconds, a
  number it was never shown.
- Verification-pass contradiction holds are no longer discarded: a pass-2 ad
  the reviewer flags as contradictory is now removed from the cut list and
  surfaces in the pending-review queue, matching pass 1. Previously its full
  span cut silently.
- A cross-episode pattern is no longer rewritten from a trimmed correction
  when a large trimmed boundary does not land near a transcript segment
  edge; unanchored 20 second and larger trims no longer propagate to future
  episodes.
- Trim recovery skips markers that merged multiple distinct ads, matching the
  reviewer's expand-only rule, so a recovered sub-span cannot drop a
  still-confirmed sub-ad.
- The chapters JSON and the applied-cut list persist in one database write,
  removing the window where a failure between the two could poison the next
  recut's chapter remap.

## [2.63.0] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- The cross-fetch differential stage no longer silently auto-cuts real show
  content as a "dynamically inserted" ad, and no longer drops real ads (#541).
  When a CDN re-encodes the whole file on the second fetch, alignment fails
  wholesale and real content reads as "differing"; a genuine dynamically served
  ad, by contrast, is often never transcribed, so it carries no ad-language text
  at all. The reliable discriminator is the differential FRACTION, not the
  transcript:
  - Whole-file re-encode guard: the differential is discarded (status
    `unreliable_reencode`, zero regions) only when BOTH more than 70% of the run
    reads as differential AND confirmed-identical coverage is under 15% -- the
    wholesale-misalignment signature of a re-encode. A real show, even an
    ad-heavy one, keeps meaningful identical coverage, so requiring both keeps a
    correctly-aligned episode's discrete ads.
  - Uncorroborated differential regions are now held for review instead of being
    silently cut or silently dropped. A region that truly overlaps a marker from
    an independent stage (fingerprint / text pattern / cue) still cuts as a
    corroborated ad; a Claude overlap only counts when the span has real
    transcript coverage, since the model is shown the differential as a hint
    and on an untranscribed span its flag would just echo that hint. A region
    with no genuine corroboration surfaces in the pending-review queue for
    one-tap approval, so a real transcript-less DAI ad is caught while a
    spurious re-encode differential never solo-cuts. Held differentials also
    never merge with nearby non-differential markers unless they truly
    overlap: mere adjacency neither cuts the held span nor holds the real ad.
  - The audio hint sent to the model for a differential range is now a
    middle-ground signal ("audio differs across fetches ... LIKELY an ad, flag it
    when the surrounding audio and transcript are consistent") rather than the
    old absolute "CONFIRMED ... not part of the show".

## [2.62.1] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- The ad reviewer now holds a "confirmed" ad for review when its own reasoning
  says part of the span is not an ad (for example a preroll whose tail bleeds
  into show banter), and recovers the ad-only boundary so the review screen
  offers a one-tap trimmed approval instead of an all-or-nothing cut. The
  reviewer prompt now also requires adjusted boundaries whenever the reasoning
  identifies non-ad content, so these land as automatic trims rather than
  holds. Recovered boundaries shorter than the minimum ad length are treated
  as unreliable and left for manual review.
- VAD-gap ad extension no longer swallows show content across a dynamic-ad
  insertion seam. When the audio just past an extended boundary repeats a long
  verbatim run of speech from inside the ad (the tell-tale duplicated seconds a
  dynamic insertion leaves around its splice), the extension stops at the real
  boundary. The match threshold is set high enough that shared sponsor phrases
  ("this episode is brought to you by") do not trigger it.
- Approving held ads (recut) now keeps the served and embedded chapter
  timestamps correct. The applied cut list is persisted with each render and
  the chapters are remapped arithmetically against it, with no AI call. For
  episodes processed before this release (no stored cut list) the chapters are
  left untouched, exactly as before, rather than risk a wrong remap; use
  Regenerate Chapters to refresh them.

## [2.62.0] - 2026-07-17

### Performance
- Chunked transcription now runs one ffmpeg pass per chunk instead of two or
  three: the preprocessing filters (and FLAC encode on the API path) are folded
  into chunk extraction. Saves roughly 1-2 minutes of decode/encode per long
  episode plus the intermediate WAV disk traffic.
- The audio analysis stage runs its independent components (volume, audio cue,
  silence) concurrently, with splice detection starting as soon as the volume
  frames it needs are ready. The stage runs twice per episode, so long episodes
  save minutes of sequential ffmpeg.
- The differential fetch (second download for DAI diffing) now runs in a worker
  thread overlapped with audio analysis instead of blocking between stages. It
  still starts only after transcription so the two CDN fetches stay separated
  in time.
- Keep-content mode sends its detection windows through the same parallel
  window runner as normal detection instead of one blocking LLM call at a time.
- The audio fingerprint scan computes similarities with batched numpy instead
  of a per-position Python loop: 4-7x faster, bit-identical results (pinned by
  a new equivalence test).
- Text pattern matching batches all sliding-window TF-IDF transforms per bucket
  into one call.
- Serving RSS to a subscriber no longer blocks on an upstream refresh when a
  cached feed exists: the cache is served immediately and the refresh happens
  in the background (bounded to one in-flight refresh per feed). Forced
  refreshes and first-time fetches still refresh synchronously.
- /system/status caches its filesystem walks for 45 seconds instead of
  stat-ing the full library twice per request.
- The leader worker no longer performs a redundant sequential refresh of every
  feed at startup; the background scheduler's first pass covers it in parallel.

### Changed
- Full-codebase cleanup pass (no intended feature changes). Dead code removed
  across the backend: unused config constants, ten unreferenced methods, the
  never-executed MIGRATION_INDEXES_SQL block, an unreachable transcriber API
  branch, and assorted unused imports. Duplicated logic consolidated behind
  shared helpers: UTC timestamp formatting (utils/time), overlap math
  (overlap_seconds), episode and podcast JSON serializers in the API layer,
  the cue-template route preamble, the ad detector's detection/verification
  window orchestration, reviewer verdict stamping and history recording in
  the processing pipeline, and quiet file unlinks in the transcriber.
- Frontend cleanup to match: shared SortHeader and ScopeBadge components,
  shared time-input commit helpers for the two audio editors, a single
  useCollapsibleOpen hook for panels that gate work on their open state, and
  removal of inert state (the ad review modal's busy flag, dead branches in
  the cue episode picker).
- apiRequest now passes FormData bodies through, so OPML and cue-template
  imports get the shared 401 handling. Both imports are single-attempt
  (no retry) because they are not idempotent.
- Per-feed processing mode (pass-through, skip ad detection, keep content only,
  standard) is now resolved once per episode by a single precedence function
  instead of independent column checks scattered through the pipeline. The
  toggles stay independent in the API; feed responses now include a
  processingMode field with the resolved mode, and the feed settings hints key
  off it.
- Global settings defaults are driven by one registry covering seeding, reset,
  and the GET /settings defaults, replacing four hand-synchronized catalogs.
  Seeded values, reset behavior, and API payloads are unchanged (pinned by a
  snapshot test).
- Reprocess-mode rules (reprocess, full, llm, recut) live in one spec table
  consumed by all three reprocess endpoints; recut remains single-episode only.
- Chapter generation calls the LLM through the shared retry and rate-limit
  classification path, so transient provider errors retry with backoff and
  fire webhook alerts instead of silently degrading to generic titles.
- Table DDL is single-sourced: schema creation and the create-missing-tables
  path share per-table constants instead of hand-synchronized copies.
- Episode id path parameters are validated once at the API blueprint level;
  malformed ids now return 400 on all API routes instead of falling through to
  a database 404 on some.
- The frontend has shared building blocks that previously existed as drifting
  copies: button style recipes, success/warning theme tokens each theme can
  restyle, a Modal/ConfirmModal shell, a settings field registry that
  closes the hydration-vs-diff drift bug class, a transient-status hook that
  fixes leaked timers, and a shared API error-message helper.

### Fixed
- The reviewer contradiction guard now uses regex patterns instead of four
  literal substrings, so verdicts whose reasoning says the span is not an ad
  (for example "contain no advertising content" or "is not advertising") are
  held for review instead of being cut. The literal patterns missed real
  reasonings on several episodes while the spans were cut anyway.
- The idx_patterns_scope index was defined but never created on any database;
  a migration now creates it.
- Episode pages no longer fetch the full original transcript on every visit
  after the section had been opened once anywhere; the fetch now follows the
  section's open state.
- The ad review editor no longer re-downloads the full-episode waveform peaks
  and the sponsor catalog on every step between ads; both are cached for the
  session and the Reset control clears the cache properly.
- Feed detail panels (ad distribution, cue templates, feed settings) no longer
  fire their network requests while collapsed; data loads when the panel is
  opened or was left open.
- Cue-template routes no longer clear an episode's stored original-audio
  reference when the file is temporarily unreadable; only the original-audio
  serving routes keep that self-heal.

## [2.61.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added
- Per-feed "Skip ad detection" toggle in Feed Settings > Advanced (#538). Episodes
  on the feed are still transcribed and get chapters and a transcript, but the
  detection stages are skipped entirely: no first-pass detection, no verification
  pass, no audio-cue analysis, and no cross-fetch second download. Nothing is cut,
  so the served audio matches the original. For ad-free shows; saves the detection
  LLM cost. Skip-detection runs are marked in the per-run stats and never get the
  low-ad-yield badge.

### Documentation
- The "Keep content only" detection mode is now documented (#537): a new section in
  docs/how-it-works.md explains the inverted detection, its safety gates, and the
  per-episode fallback to normal removal; the feed settings panel shows a short
  description of the mode before it is selected instead of only after.

## [2.60.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added
- Held-for-review ads now keep the reviewer's proposed boundary trim. When the
  reviewer holds an ad because part of the detected span is show content (for
  example an outro merged into a post-roll ad break), the episode page shows the
  reviewer's reasoning and offers a "Confirm trimmed" button that approves only
  the ad portion; the rest stays in the episode. Previously approval was
  all-or-nothing at the full detected span, and the reviewer's trim was
  discarded. A trimmed approval also survives later reprocesses: a re-detected
  wider span is clamped to the approved trim instead of re-cutting the content
  the user kept.

### Fixed
- Back up now, Sync now, and the other outline-style settings buttons were
  nearly invisible in dark mode (the border color is darker than the card they
  sit on). They now use the standard button style, which is clearly visible in
  both themes (#534).

## [2.59.0] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Secondary buttons (AI Models Refresh, Security Logout, and similar) were
  invisible in dark mode because the secondary color matched the card color.
  The dark-mode secondary color is now distinct, so those buttons are visible
  again (#526).
- History page now shows the average processing time. It was reading the wrong
  response field and always rendered a dash (#532).

### Added
- History page: the Completed and Failed stat cards are now clickable and filter
  the list below by that status (click again to clear); the status dropdown stays
  in sync (#532).

## [2.58.0] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Ad detection and chapter generation no longer fail with an HTTP 400 when using
  newer Anthropic models (Sonnet 5, Fable 5, Opus 4.7/4.8), which reject the
  temperature parameter. The parameter is now omitted for those models, on both
  the Anthropic API and OpenRouter paths, including the JSON-format capability
  probe (#530).

## [2.57.0] - 2026-07-15

### Changed
- The top navigation bar now stays pinned to the top of the page while scrolling,
  on both desktop and mobile, so switching sections no longer means scrolling back
  up (#526).

### Fixed
- Pass-through feeds no longer serve a non-MP3 enclosure under an .mp3 name when the
  codec cannot be probed. If the codec is not confidently MP3 (including when ffprobe
  returns nothing), the audio is converted to MP3 before it is served, and a file that
  cannot be converted fails instead of being served mislabeled.

## [2.56.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Logout button in the top navigation bar, next to the search and theme-toggle
  icons, so logging out no longer requires opening Settings > Security. Shown only
  when a password is set (#526).

### Fixed
- Canceling an episode no longer breaks when its feed was deleted mid-processing.
  Deleting a feed now cancels any in-flight or queued job for that feed and frees the
  processing lock, and the cancel endpoint tears down an orphaned job instead of
  returning 404 when the episode record is already gone (#525).
- Settings > Notifications > Email no longer intermittently sticks on "Loading email
  settings..." until a manual refresh. Fixed a cached-first-render race in the
  query-to-form sync hook so form state seeds correctly on a remount (#527).

## [2.55.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- Generated chapters are now embedded into the processed MP3 as ID3
  frames, in addition to the podcast:chapters JSON (#523). Players that
  only read embedded chapters, like Castro, pick them up. The manual
  Regenerate Chapters action rewrites the embedded set too.

### Changed
- Feed settings panel reorganized for consistency. Basic settings
  (network, source feed, auto-process, detection, language, hide
  unprocessed, tags) sit at the top; the cue threshold moved into the
  Cue tuning overrides card; the remaining rarely-changed controls
  (snap toggles, max ad duration, cue gating, pass-through, cross-fetch)
  live in a new collapsed Advanced card. Tags is now a simple inline
  row instead of its own collapsed card.

## [2.54.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- The feed page artwork now links to the show's website in a new tab
  (#521). The URL comes from the feed's channel-level RSS link element,
  captured on every refresh; no link, no anchor.
- Pass-through mode (#521). A per-feed toggle that serves episodes
  exactly as published: downloaded and hosted by MinusPod with no
  transcription, ad detection, or cutting. The served feed URL stays
  the same, so processing can be paused and resumed per feed without
  touching your podcast app. Good for archiving originals. Pass-through
  runs show up in Processing stats with their downloaded duration.

## [2.53.1] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- Docs: a glossary defining every term the app uses, with each entry
  linked to the doc section that covers it. Also documents the
  cross-fetch differential (previously undocumented) and the new
  Processing stats section.

### Fixed
- The Transcript, Original Transcript, and Processing stats sections at
  the bottom of the episode page now carry the same spacing as the
  sections above them instead of stacking edge to edge. The transcript
  sections had always been missing it; adding a third section made the
  gap obvious.

## [2.53.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- Per-run processing stats (#519). Each run now records what it actually
  worked with: downloaded audio duration, transcript segments, detection
  windows answered, hits per stage (audio fingerprint, text patterns,
  cross-fetch differential, LLM), final marker buckets (cut / held /
  kept), the verification scan result, and seconds removed. The episode
  page shows it all in a "Processing stats" section at the bottom,
  collapsed by default, and the History page gains an Audio column with
  each run's downloaded length. Two runs of the same episode that got
  different ad loads from the publisher now explain themselves.
- Low ad yield badge (#519). When an episode removes far less ad time
  than the feed's recent average, the episode page flags it with the
  numbers, so a lightly-filled download does not read as a silent
  detection failure.
- Verification verdict on the episode page (#519). Completed episodes
  state the result of the second scan of the output audio, which
  previously existed only in logs.
- The feed's declared episode duration (itunes:duration) is captured at
  discovery and compared against the downloaded copy, surfacing dynamic
  ad insertion variance per download.
- The cross-fetch differential stage now runs automatically on feeds
  that look DAI-served (a detected platform or a DAI-prefix enclosure
  URL), so inserted ads are caught on the first processing without
  turning the per-feed setting on. The feed setting is now a three-way
  choice (Auto / On / Off) and shows whether the stage actually runs on
  the feed; an explicit Off still opts out.

## [2.52.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- Feed refresh times now show the time of day, not just the date (#516).
  The feed page's "Updated" line includes the clock time, and the
  dashboard header shows when the last check of all feeds finished
  (stamped by the 15-minute background pass and the Refresh All action).
- New "Feed Refresh Failed" webhook/email event (#516). Fires once a
  podcast's origin RSS feed has failed three checks in a row spaced at
  least ten minutes apart (roughly half an hour of continuous failure;
  rapid retries from podcast-app polls don't inflate the count). One
  alert per outage, and a burst cap keeps a network-wide outage from
  sending one email per feed. Past that threshold the feed's dashboard
  card shows an amber "Refresh failing" marker and the feed page shows
  "Refresh failing since <time>", so you can see how long it has been
  broken. Everything clears on the next successful refresh. Only fetch
  and parse failures count: internal errors never blame the publisher's
  feed.

### Fixed
- Ad Review play buttons no longer die silently after the original-only
  retention sweep (#517). When `originalRetentionDays` is shorter than
  `retentionDays`, the sweep deleted the retained original audio from
  disk but left the episode's `original_file` column set, so Ad Review
  kept offering play buttons whose audio URL returned 404. The sweep now
  clears the column with the file, and the original.mp3/peaks routes
  self-heal rows left stale by older versions, so the play button
  disappears instead of failing.

## [2.51.3] - 2026-07-13

### Changed
- Mobile Ad Review card actions are back on a single line at every
  phone width: play, Confirm ad, Not an ad, Edit. The decision buttons
  grow from their label width (they can never shrink below it, so
  neither wraps into a taller button), Edit stays compact, and the
  buttons are sized for thumbs. Below 370px the labels drop a size so
  the row still fits a 320px screen.

## [2.51.2] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- The Edit button on mobile Ad Review cards no longer stretches across
  the full row; it is a compact control right-aligned opposite the play
  button.
- The Sponsors/Normalizations tab switcher no longer stretches to full
  width on mobile with a long empty border trailing the tabs; it sizes
  to its content.

## [2.51.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- Mobile Ad Review cards no longer render a lopsided action row: the
  renamed "Confirm ad" label wrapped into a two-line button beside a
  one-line "Not an ad". The two decision buttons now split a row of
  their own (labels never wrap), play and Edit share a compact second
  row, and the sponsor moved into the metadata line instead of
  dangling as a bare word above the buttons.

## [2.51.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed
- The cover art badge now has a solid hulu-green ring with a tight
  neon glow, rendered supersampled for smooth edges (#514). The old
  black drop shadow disappeared on black cover art, leaving the
  near-black chip invisible; the green edge separates it on dark,
  light, and busy covers without smearing gray across light ones. The
  badge revision bump changes the artwork cache-bust token (and a new
  salt sidecar invalidates the on-disk variant cache) so podcast apps
  re-fetch the updated art.
- The settings reset actions ("Reset Prompts to Default", "Reset
  Reviewer Prompts to Default", "Reset All Episodes", and the save
  bar's "Reset All") are styled as outlined destructive buttons and all
  require a second click to confirm within 3 seconds (#513). Only
  Reset All Episodes had the confirm step before; the others fired
  immediately.
- The Ad Review tab no longer scrolls horizontally on desktop. The
  fixed nine-column table (which forced a 68rem minimum width) is now a
  two-line row list that flexes to any viewport: episode title, badges,
  and actions on the first line; podcast, date, time span, confidence,
  stage, and sponsor on the second. Sorting moved from column headers
  into the filter bar at every width (the control that previously
  existed only on mobile).
- Review actions are named for what they mean instead of the ambiguous
  Approve/Dismiss pair: "Confirm ad" records that the detection really
  is an ad, "Not an ad" records that it is not. The "Rejected" status
  is now labeled "Not cut" (the bucket covers both validation rejects
  and spans restored after a human "Not an ad"), so a pipeline outcome
  is not confused with a human decision; the resolution badge and stats
  card use "Not an ad" in place of "Dismissed". The ad editor modal's
  "Reject" button (the same human decision) is now "Not an ad" too, and
  the episode page follows suit: the "Rejected Detections" panel is now
  "Detections Not Cut", its stray "Not Ad" badges read "Not an ad", and
  the held-ads panel shows "Confirm & Recut" / "Confirm ad" / "Not an
  ad" with the batch action reading "Apply N confirmed & recut".
- Reviewing several held ads no longer costs one full recut per approval
  (#509). With more than one ad held for review, confirming records the
  decision only; an "Apply N confirmed & recut" action at the bottom of
  the Held for Review panel runs a single recut that applies every
  confirmed hold at once (the recut already applied all stored
  corrections in one pass). Confirming a held ad now also annotates the
  marker server-side (mirroring how a dismissal resolves one), so the
  approved count survives reloads and uses the same tolerance matching
  as the rest of the review flow. Confirming the last unreviewed ad of a
  set keeps the one-tap confirm-and-recut finish, as does an episode
  with a single held ad; confirmations made without retained original
  audio still apply on the next reprocess as before.

### Fixed
- Clearing a prompt box and saving no longer wedges the settings form
  (#513). The backend treats an empty prompt as "use the default" and
  serves the default text back, so the cleared local field never
  matched the server value: Save changes stayed lit forever and a
  prompts reset needed a browser refresh before the defaults showed.
  After any save or reset the form now re-seeds itself from the
  refetched server state.

## [2.50.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed
- One precedence rule for every dual-natured setting (issue #491): the
  env var seeds the default, and a value saved in the Settings UI wins
  after the first edit. Stage tunables (temperatures, token budgets,
  window geometry, `OLLAMA_NUM_CTX`) previously worked the other way
  around -- a set env var beat the UI and rendered the control
  read-only. They now follow the same env-seeds-default model as every
  other env-backed setting; the UI control stays editable and shows the
  env var as the source of its default.
- `auto_process_enabled`, `feed_auth_enabled`, and
  `artwork_watermark_enabled` gained env bootstrap seeds
  (`AUTO_PROCESS_ENABLED`, `FEED_AUTH_ENABLED`,
  `ARTWORK_WATERMARK_ENABLED`) so a fresh deploy is fully configurable
  from compose. A one-shot corrective migration protects rows customized
  before the is_default flag existed from being clobbered by the boot
  resync -- customized values are never overwritten.

### Added
- The three size caps are now runtime settings with UI controls and API
  fields, seeded by their existing env vars: episode download cap
  (`MAX_AUDIO_DOWNLOAD_MB`, default 500 MB, floor 1 MB, no ceiling --
  values over 10 GB keep working with an advisory warning), artwork cap
  (`MINUSPOD_MAX_ARTWORK_BYTES`, default 25 MB, clamped 64 KiB to
  50 MiB), and RSS body cap (`MINUSPOD_MAX_RSS_BYTES`, default 200 MB,
  floor 1 MB, no ceiling). Existing env values keep working unchanged;
  raising a cap no longer requires a container restart.
- Setting `FEED_AUTH_ENABLED=true` from the environment mints the feed
  auth key at boot when none exists (retrieve it in Settings), instead
  of failing closed and locking out every feed client.
- A one-shot migration accompanies the stage-tunable precedence flip:
  where an env var was masking a stored UI value, the stored value
  adopts the env value that was winning, so the effective tunable does
  not change at upgrade.

## [2.49.0] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- Embedded ID3v2 chapters (CHAP/CTOC) are now remapped onto the post-cut
  timeline instead of being copied through with stale timestamps. ffmpeg
  copies the input's chapters by default, so a processed episode kept
  chapter marks that pointed at the wrong content once ads were removed
  (#500). remove_ads now probes the input's chapters, shifts each one by
  the removed time (compensating for the inserted beep), drops chapters
  that sat entirely inside a cut, and feeds the corrected list back into
  the same ffmpeg invocation as an ffmetadata input. Chapterless files
  are explicitly stripped of chapters as a guard. The remap composes
  across the two-pass recut path because each render remaps its own
  input's chapters with its own cuts.
- Post-cut timestamps in VTT transcripts, plain-text transcripts, final
  segments, and Podcasting 2.0 JSON chapters no longer drift early by
  the length of the replacement beep per preceding cut (~1.0 s each).
  `adjust_timestamp` gains a `replacement_duration` parameter: each cut
  shifts later content by (cut length - beep length), matching what the
  render actually does. The pass-2 verification maps got the same
  correction in both directions: the reused-transcript path now projects
  segments onto the beeped timeline exactly as a re-transcription would
  see it, and `_map_to_original` / `_map_correction_to_processed` account
  for the beep when converting pass-2 detections and user corrections
  between the original and processed timelines.
- The two-pass cut model counts beeps exactly. Asset generation now uses
  the cuts each render actually applied (one beep per rendered cut,
  pass-2 cuts mapped back to original coordinates) instead of the
  pre-merge UI ad list, timestamp adjustment credits one replacement per
  source span even when cuts from different passes merge in original
  coordinates, and the beep length used for timestamp math is resolved
  from the same frozen asset path the render uses.
- A failed ffprobe chapter read no longer strips embedded chapters from
  the output: probe failure falls back to ffmpeg's default chapter
  passthrough (stale but recoverable) with a warning, and only a
  definitively chapterless input is stripped explicitly. Chapter lists
  stay contiguous when a sub-second sliver chapter is dropped.

### Changed
- LLM benchmark raw storage moved to schema v2: response bodies now live
  in one JSONL shard per model (`results/raw/responses/<model>.jsonl`,
  lines of `{call_id, body}`) instead of one `.txt` file per call, and
  prompt files are no longer stored at all (they reconstruct
  deterministically from the committed corpus). `results/raw` drops from
  48,096 files / 311 MB to under 100 files, and the file count now stays
  flat as the corpus grows. `calls.jsonl` records carry
  `schema_version: 2`, `response_path` points at the shard, and
  `prompt_path` is gone.
- `benchmarks/llm/src/benchmark/report.py` (2,147 lines) split into a
  `report/` package: `aggregate.py` (stats, tiering, CI math),
  `sections.py` (Markdown builders), `charts.py` (SVG renderers), with
  `render()` in `__init__.py`. Rendered output is byte-identical.

### Added
- `benchmark migrate-raw`: one-time, idempotent conversion of a v1
  checkout. Every response body is verified byte-exact in its shard
  before the source `.txt` is deleted, every prompt file must
  reconstruct byte-exact from the corpus before deletion (33 orphaned
  prompt files whose hashes match no `calls.jsonl` record were kept),
  and `calls.jsonl` is rewritten via tmp+rename with a timestamped
  backup.
- `benchmark show-prompt <call_id>`: rebuilds the exact user prompt for
  a stored call from `windows.json` + `metadata.toml`, recomputes
  `prompt_hash`, and reports verified / MISMATCH (exit 3 on mismatch).
  Supports `--snapshot` for runs pinned to a frozen system prompt.
- `benchmark show-response <call_id>`: prints the raw response body for
  a stored call from its per-model shard.

### Fixed
- Benchmark report output is now deterministic run to run: model
  iteration no longer inherits Python set order (rows in tie groups were
  reshuffling on every regen under hash randomization), matplotlib SVG
  element ids use a fixed `svg.hashsalt`, and the embedded SVG creation
  date is suppressed. Regenerating a report from unchanged data now
  produces byte-identical Markdown and assets, so committed-report diffs
  show only real changes.

## [2.48.4] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- Ad Review column widths rebalanced against live data so the
  Published and Resolution headers and the stage badges no longer
  truncate on desktop.

## [2.48.3] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- Detection Statistics card on the Ad Review tab: totals for needs
  review, pending, rejected, accepted, confirmed, and dismissed
  detections across all podcasts.

### Fixed
- The Ad Review table now uses a fixed column layout so it fills the
  page without inner scrolling on desktops (1024 px and up keep a
  scroll fallback). Sponsor moved under the episode title, long text
  truncates with the full value on hover, and the ad span's duration
  shows on hover over the time range.
- The Ad Review podcast filter lists podcasts alphabetically.

## [2.48.2] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- The Ad Review table fits a 1280 px desktop without scrolling inside
  its container: long episode, podcast, and sponsor names truncate with
  the full text shown on hover.

## [2.48.1] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- The Ad Review tab now works on phones: rows render as stacked cards
  instead of a table that needed horizontal scrolling, filter dropdowns
  no longer overflow the filter card, and a sort control appears in the
  filter bar on small screens (the table's sortable headers remain on
  desktop).

## [2.48.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- Ad Review tab on the Patterns page: one paginated list of every ad
  detection across all podcasts, with status and podcast filters, text
  search, and sortable columns. Defaults to detections that need a
  decision (held for review or rejected, with no correction yet), so
  unresolved rejected detections can be worked through in one place
  instead of episode by episode (issue #417). Rows support Approve,
  Dismiss, waveform Edit, and audio preview using the same correction
  flow as the episode page. New endpoint: `GET /api/v1/detections`.

## [2.47.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- Native email notifications: point MinusPod at your own SMTP server and
  get an email for the events you pick (same five events as webhooks, with
  the same 5-minute dedup on alert events). Emails are HTML with the
  MinusPod logo and a plain-text fallback; the SMTP password is stored
  encrypted; a Send test email button verifies the saved settings. Replaces
  the need for a webhook-to-email sidecar. New endpoints:
  `GET/PUT /api/v1/settings/notifications/email` and
  `POST /api/v1/settings/notifications/email/test`.
- The Webhooks settings section is now Notifications, with Email and
  Webhooks subsections. Webhook API endpoints are unchanged.

## [2.46.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Audio cue candidate cards no longer collapse on phones: the action
  buttons squeezed the label into a one-word-wide column and overflowed
  the card. Buttons now stack full-width below the candidate info on
  small screens, matching the episode page's action rows. The
  cross-episode scan modal rows wrap instead of crushing their content.

## [2.46.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- `MAX_AUDIO_DOWNLOAD_MB` env var: the per-episode download size cap is now
  configurable (default stays 500MB). Very long or high-bitrate episodes,
  like a 260-minute show at 256kbps, were hitting the hardcoded cap (#493).

### Changed
- Oversized episodes now fail permanently with a clear reason ("Audio file
  is 620MB, over the 500MB download cap; raise MAX_AUDIO_DOWNLOAD_MB to
  process it") instead of retrying a generic "Failed to download audio"
  error. The message shows up in the episode failure panel added in 2.45.0.

### Fixed
- docs: `MINUSPOD_MAX_ARTWORK_BYTES` default corrected to 25MB; the docs
  still said 5MB from before the 2.x artwork cap raise.

## [2.45.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- `Limit Exceeded` webhook event: fires when the LLM provider rejects a
  request because a spend or usage limit is exhausted (OpenRouter monthly
  key limit 403, out-of-credits 402, OpenAI `insufficient_quota`, Anthropic
  low credit balance), with the same 5-minute dedup as the other alert
  events. Previously these fired the misleading `Auth Failure` event (#491).
- Failure reasons in the UI: episodes with failed or permanently failed
  status now show the stored error message in a panel on the episode detail
  page and as a tooltip on the status badge in the episode list. The message
  was already saved and returned by the API; it was just never displayed
  outside the History page (#491).
- Webhook settings picker now lists the `Rate Limit Structural` event, which
  was valid in the backend but missing from the UI dropdown.

### Changed
- Quota and billing errors no longer fire the `Auth Failure` webhook; they
  fire `Limit Exceeded` instead. `Auth Failure` now means bad credentials.
  Update webhook subscriptions if you relied on the old routing.
- Limit-exceeded errors are now non-retryable at every level: no window
  retry backoff (an OpenAI `insufficient_quota` 429 previously burned the
  full cycle) and no episode re-queue -- the episode is marked permanently
  failed right away, since retrying cannot succeed until credits are added
  or the limit is raised. Reprocess the episode after fixing the limit.

## [2.44.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Feed-wide cue candidate dismissal: a Dismiss button on each audio-cue
  candidate stores the sound's fingerprint, and every future candidate scan
  in the feed suppresses matching sounds into a collapsed Dismissed group
  with per-entry undo. Existing candidate caches rescan once to apply.
- Verdict-fed cue threshold suggestion: confirmed/rejected detection reviews
  now steer the suggested match threshold (rejections raise the proposed
  floor, confirmations cap it; a clean labeled gap replaces the unsupervised
  estimate). Suggestion-only, applied manually as before.
- Per-template verdict hints in the cue templates panel: rejections
  clustered just above the threshold suggest raising it; rejections spread
  across the score range suggest re-capturing the cue.

## [2.43.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- Play buttons on Rejected Detections rows: each rejected marker can now be
  played from the episode's retained original audio (same windowed player
  the Held for Review section uses), so you can hear what a detection is
  before confirming or dismissing it. Buttons appear only while the original
  audio is retained, and saving a correction stops any in-progress preview.

## [2.43.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- Base images upgraded from Ubuntu 24.04 to Ubuntu 26.04 (GPU and CPU variants). System ffmpeg moves from 6.x to 8.0, bringing faster transcode paths and current upstream security fixes.
- GPU image no longer builds on `nvidia/cuda` base images; it now uses plain `ubuntu:26.04`. ctranslate2 statically links the CUDA runtime and cuDNN/cuBLAS already come from pip `nvidia-*` wheels, so the CUDA base layer was redundant. This also sidesteps the driver >= 580 requirement that CUDA 13.x base images enforce (the only NVIDIA base images published for Ubuntu 26.04). CUDA userland now comes solely from the pip wheels in the venv; there is no apt-level CUDA layer.
- Container Python upgraded from 3.11 to 3.12 (deadsnakes), matching the version requirements.txt is compiled against.
- PyTorch upgraded from 2.6.0 (cu124) to 2.13.0 (cu126). CUDA 12.x wheels keep the host driver requirement at >= 525.
- torchaudio removed from both images and CI: nothing imports it.
- Removed `pebble` (unused service manager shipped in the ubuntu:26.04 OCI rootfs) from both images; its embedded Go dependencies carry unfixed HIGH CVEs.

## [2.42.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Cross-episode scan playback and per-episode breakdown (#350): each
  discovered candidate in the cross-episode scan results has a play button
  that plays the segment from the target episode's retained original, and a
  collapsible per-episode list enumerating every occurrence of the candidate
  in every scanned episode with timestamps, each playable from that
  episode's audio. Scan-response candidates gain an `episodes` field
  (`episodeId`, `matchCount`, `matches`); results cached by older versions
  show a rescan hint instead.
- Play button on Held for Review rows: each held ad on the episode page can
  be auditioned (its window of the retained original) before choosing
  Approve & Recut or Dismiss, matching the Cue Matches play button. Shown
  only while the original audio is retained.

## [2.41.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Source RSS URL in Feed Settings (#484): each feed's original source URL is
  shown with a copy button and can be edited. The server fetches and parses
  the replacement URL before saving (invalid URLs are rejected and nothing
  changes), clears the stored ETag/Last-Modified validators, and refreshes
  the feed immediately. Existing episodes are kept and matched by GUID.
  `sourceUrl` is accepted by `PATCH /feeds/{slug}` and included in its
  response. The "Starting RSS refresh from" log line now logs at INFO with
  the query string scrubbed, so the pulled URL is visible in default logs.
- Per-feed episode status counts (#466): `GET /feeds` and `GET /feeds/{slug}`
  return a `statusCounts` object (discovered, pending, processing, completed,
  failed, permanently_failed, deferred) computed in the existing feed query.
  The feed detail page shows stat cards above Feed Settings with the
  per-status counts (colored to match the episode badges) plus totals for
  episodes processed, ads removed, time saved, and LLM cost. Dashboard feed
  cards and list rows show compact per-status count pills.
- Offline queue (#482, off by default): when the LLM provider or Whisper API
  endpoint is unreachable (connection refused, DNS failure, timeout, or
  repeated 5xx -- including a tripped circuit breaker), episodes defer with a
  new `deferred` status instead of failing. A background tick probes the
  unreachable service about every 5 minutes, resets the LLM circuit breaker
  when it answers, and re-queues the deferred episodes automatically.
  Episodes that wait longer than the configured TTL are marked permanently
  failed with an explicit log line and failure webhook. Configure via
  `GET/PUT /settings/offline-queue` (enabled, ttlHours 1-720) or the new
  Offline Queue section on the Settings page, which also shows how many
  episodes are waiting. Auth errors, rate limits, and bad responses still
  fail normally. Deferral does not burn retry attempts; deferred episodes can
  be reprocessed manually at any time; `GET /system/queue` reports the
  deferred count.

### Changed

- Feed tags moved into the Feed Settings section on the feed detail page as a
  nested sub-section (open/closed state is preserved).
- soupsieve bumped 2.8.3 to 2.8.4 (CVE-2026-49476, CVE-2026-49477).
- `deferred_at` and `deferred_service` columns added to the episodes table
  and `deferred` added to the status CHECK constraint via a data-preserving
  table rebuild migration.

## [2.40.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Splice-evidence audio analysis: a per-episode scan for encoded digital
  silence, loudness steps, and spectral steps, stored under `splice_evidence`
  in the audio analysis JSON with per-feed calibration. Used to corroborate
  boundary markers (within 3s), snap terminal ad starts to the strongest deep
  silence (never across content speech), hold long cuts with zero splice
  evidence for review instead of cutting silently, and annotate detection and
  reviewer prompts. New settings: `splice_evidence_enabled`,
  `splice_veto_enabled`, `veto_min_cut_seconds`, `terminal_snap_window_seconds`.
- Cross-fetch differential (per-feed opt-in `differentialFetchEnabled`, off by
  default): after transcription, each new episode is re-fetched with a
  different podcast-client User-Agent and the two files are aligned. Differing
  regions are treated as dynamically inserted; they corroborate markers, feed
  the LLM prompts, and become `dai_differential` detections (confidence 0.95,
  still gated by the validator and reviewer). Results are stored per episode
  and shown on the episode page. Feeds whose enclosure URLs route through known
  DAI prefix domains get a "DAI likely" hint in feed settings.
- Tail re-transcription: when the transcript ends 10-600 seconds before the
  audio does (`tail_retranscribe_min_seconds` /
  `tail_retranscribe_max_seconds`), the tail is re-transcribed without
  voice-activity filtering so quiet DAI post-rolls reach the LLM windows
  instead of being skipped.
- Ad markers record what audio evidence backed them (`corroborated_by`:
  transition pair, volume anomaly, splice evidence, or cross-fetch
  differential); the episode page shows it as a badge.

### Fixed

- vad_gap markers on untranscribed tails are no longer confidence-clamped for
  having "no ad signals in transcript" when audio evidence corroborates them
  (for untranscribed audio, Whisper never produced transcript signals, so the
  condition was always true); uncorroborated tail markers are held for review
  instead of being cut silently.
- Reviewer verdicts that contradict their own reasoning (verdict confirmed or
  adjust with reasoning like "no advertisement content") hold the marker for
  review instead of auto-cutting. Reviewer LLM failures keep the documented
  trust-pass-1 fallback, now covered by an explicit test.
- The cut renderer kept several seconds more audio than the markers
  specified; processed duration now matches original minus applied cuts
  within 1 second.
- Per-feed splice threshold filtering (digital_silence_min_s,
  deep_silence_min_s) is not wired: the calibration module computes and
  stores these values per episode, but nothing reads them at detection
  time. Consumers check calibration.status only. Threshold-based event
  filtering is left for a later change.

## [2.39.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Scheduled database backups (#465): a cron-driven snapshot of the SQLite
  database, written with the online backup API to a configurable directory
  (default `/app/data/backups/` in the container), off by default. Keep count 1
  overwrites a single fixed file; higher counts write timestamped files and
  prune the oldest. New "Scheduled Backups" section under Settings > Data &
  Security with an enable toggle, cron schedule, destination path, keep count,
  last-run status, and a "Back up now" button that works even with scheduling
  off (rate-limited to 6 per hour). New endpoints: `GET/PUT
  /api/v1/settings/db-backup`, `POST /api/v1/system/db-backup/run`. Scheduled
  snapshots are plain SQLite files and are never encrypted, even when
  `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` is set; treat the destination directory like a
  credential store.

## [2.38.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Cross-episode cue finding (#350): `POST /feeds/{slug}/cue-cross-episode-scan` fingerprints 2-5 selected episodes (all with retained originals) and reports audio segments that recur anywhere in their bodies, not just the head/tail windows the per-episode scan covers. Results are in the first selected episode's timeline and feed the existing Make-template flow. A "Find cues across episodes" action in the Audio Cue Templates panel drives it: episode picker, background scan with polling, candidate list with per-episode match counts.
- Cue window auto-optimizer (#350): `POST /feeds/{slug}/cue-templates/{templateId}/optimize-window` sweeps an 11x11 grid of start/end trims (0.1s steps, up to 0.5s each way) and proposes the window with the highest mean match score across the source episode and up to 4 sibling episodes. Results are cached per template with the same claim/poll semantics as the other cue scans and invalidated whenever the window changes; returns 409 when the source original audio has been aged out. `PATCH /cue-templates/{id}` now accepts `sourceOffsetS`/`durationS` and re-extracts the stored audio blobs from the retained original, enforcing the feed's capture bounds (409 when the original is gone).
- Optimize window row action in the Audio Cue Templates panel (#350): runs the window optimizer for a template and expands an inline before/after panel with window bounds, mean scores, and per-episode peaks, plus Apply, Discard, and Rescan. Apply moves the window through the template PATCH; when the source original aged out between scan and apply, the 409 shows inline. A window that already scores highest is labeled as such instead of offering an apply.

### Changed

- When `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` is set but no login password is configured, the Security section's no-password warning now distinguishes the two credentials: the passphrase encrypts stored API keys but does not restrict access, so the instance is still unprotected until a password is set (#461). Warning severity is unchanged.
- Docs (#350): the audio-cue reference now covers the cross-episode scan and window optimizer, and drops a scan-time estimate that was never measured plus a rename action that does not exist.
- The cached-scan state machine is parameterized over its primary key, so the candidate, threshold, cross-episode, and window-optimizer families share one claim/poll/save implementation instead of four near-copies.
- The cross-episode scan modal and the window-optimizer panel are split out of `CueTemplatesPanel` into their own components with a shared scan-query hook and style module.
- Dependency updates: pillow 12.3.0, huggingface-hub 1.22.0, anthropic 0.116.0, ctranslate2 4.8.1; frontend vite 8.1.3, @tanstack/react-query 5.101.2, recharts 3.9.2, eslint 10.6.0, @tailwindcss/vite 4.3.2; CI docker actions setup-buildx 4.2.0, build-push 7.3.0, login 4.4.0.

## [2.37.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Ad break filler-gap merge (#458): when one ad-break contains multiple detected ads separated only by ad-transition music or silence, the short gaps are now merged into a single contiguous cut. The discriminator is actual speech content in the gap (not wall-clock time), so ads separated by real show content are never merged. New setting `minContentBetweenAdsSeconds` (default 12.0s, 0 disables) controls the threshold; exposed in the Ad Detection settings panel. Thanks @apparle for the report and fixture.
- Held for review (#350): two per-feed opt-ins hold an ad for a human decision instead of cutting or discarding it. Max ad duration holds any detection longer than the feed's cap, including high-confidence ones that previously bypassed the length check. Cue-gated approval only auto-cuts ads backed by audio-cue evidence and holds the rest (manual markers are exempt from the gate; verification-pass proposals are always held on gated feeds). Held ads stay in the published audio and appear in a Held for Review section on the episode page with Approve & Recut (cuts via the existing recut, no LLM re-run) and Dismiss actions; episode lists show a held count. New API fields: `pendingReviewMarkers`, `pendingReviewCount`, and feed settings `maxAdDurationOverride` / `cueGatedApproval`.

### Fixed (pre-release hardening)

- Held-for-review cut safety across passes: the verification pass never cuts inside a first-pass held region; a recut never resurrects a previously-cut ad after a feed later enables cue gating or a duration cap; dismissing a held marker clears its held state and the pending-review count; a review ad on a cue-gated feed without cue evidence is held, not cut, regardless of confidence rounding.
- Ad-break merge correctness: the filler-gap merge preserves audio-cue evidence across the merged span, skips any merge overlapping a user false-positive correction, and shares one bookkeeping path with the same-sponsor merge (both keep the higher fragment confidence). The `minContentBetweenAdsSeconds` setting rejects non-finite values.

## [2.36.2] - 2026-07-05

### Changed

- The login screen shows a spinner while auth status is still resolving instead of briefly flashing the login form before a redirect (contributed by @ediab, #464).

## [2.36.1] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed

- In-app playback of the processed episode is served from the UI's own origin again. The episode API returned `processedUrl` as an absolute URL on the public feed domain, so with authenticated feeds enabled the browser player loaded the audio cross-origin through the anti-scraper edge rules and playback failed. `processedUrl` is now a relative, same-origin path carrying the feed auth key, matching the transcript and chapters URLs. Podcast-app enclosure URLs in the RSS feed are unchanged.

## [2.36.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Silence boundary snap (per-feed opt-in): two new Feed settings toggles, "Snap cuts to silence" and "Snap to content transitions", and three global tunables -- silence threshold (dBFS), minimum silence duration, and maximum snap distance (Settings > Audio Cue Detection > Ad cutting). When "Snap cuts to silence" is on, LLM-detected ad edges are snapped to the midpoint of the nearest qualifying silence span (within 2s, at least 0.3s long). Cue snap takes precedence; silence snap skips any edge already committed by cue snap. Two guards prevent broken cuts: an edge snap that would reduce a removable ad below the minimum removal duration (10s) is reverted for the entire ad; a snap that would leave less than 1s gap between adjacent ads is rejected. Snap details are stored per edge in `silence_snap` and surfaced as a "Silence snapped" badge in the episode ad list.

### Fixed

- Auth redirect loop (issue #460): fresh or incognito browsers got stuck in an infinite redirect storm, growing the path to /ui/ui/ui/login with each bounce. Three interlocking frontend bugs and one backend trigger were responsible. The frontend now waits for the auth status response before acting on it, a shared helper strips the router basename from stored redirect paths so navigate() does not prepend a second /ui, and a post-login cookie check shows an actionable error if the browser discarded a Secure cookie over plain HTTP instead of looping silently. On the backend, SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE stays secure by default and now downgrades to false only when BASE_URL is explicitly plain HTTP (starts with http://). HTTPS deployments keep a Secure cookie with no configuration; plain-HTTP instances set BASE_URL=http://... (or SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false) so the browser no longer discards a Secure cookie it was issued over HTTP. An explicit SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE value is always honored.

## [2.35.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added

- Per-template match score threshold: each audio cue template can carry its own match threshold (Threshold control on the template row), taking precedence over the per-feed override and the global Template match score. Empty inherits. The Test on episode scan's run-level threshold and the Suggest threshold sweep both ignore per-template values, so diagnostics stay uniform across templates.
- Per-feed cue tuning overrides: snap confidence, snap lead/lag windows, cue-pair minimum and maximum break, maximum break fraction, and create-ads-from-cue-pairs can now be set per feed (Feed settings > Cue tuning overrides). Empty fields inherit the global settings; create-from-pairs is tri-state (on, off, or inherit).

### Changed

- The Audio Cue Detection settings section is now grouped into three cards matching the pipeline: Finding cues, Matching templates, and Ad cutting. The create-from-pairs toggle moved next to the other cue-pair settings.
- docs/audio-cues.md documents the per-feed threshold override (shipped in 2.32.0 but previously undocumented), the new per-template threshold, and the per-feed tuning overrides.

## [2.34.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- OPML export by URL: podcast apps that support "import from URL" can now pull the feed list directly. The Export controls (Settings > Data Management) became dropdown buttons for both modified and original feeds, each offering Copy URL and Download file. Copy URL points at a new key-gated route on the public feed domain (`/opml/<mode>.opml?key=...`), served on the fly and reusing the feed-auth key; it only appears while authenticated feeds is enabled, and the route returns 404 when feed auth is off so the feed list is never exposed unauthenticated. The copy URLs are surfaced by `GET /settings` as `opmlModifiedUrl` / `opmlOriginalUrl`. `opml` is now a reserved slug so no feed can shadow the route.

### Fixed

- OPML download keeps its `.opml` extension on iOS: the download is served as `application/octet-stream` instead of `application/xml`, so iOS Safari/Files no longer rewrites the filename to `.xml` or drops the extension.

## [2.33.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- Authenticated feeds: an optional global feed key (disabled by default, Settings > Data & Security) that locks the public feed surface. When enabled, the served RSS, episode mp3 (both URL shapes), transcript vtt, and chapters.json require a `?key=` query param, and the badged cover art embeds the key in its path token (`cover-minuspod-<version>-<key>.jpg`) since podcast apps reject image URLs that do not end in an image extension (proven with Pocket Casts in 2.32.5). Requests without a valid key get 401 and log "no auth key provided or is invalid"; validation is a constant-time compare against a per-request DB read, so rotation applies instantly. The key is a 64-hex `secrets.token_hex(32)` value, deliberately visible in the UI and API (private-feed bearer model), and stored plaintext because it must be read back and provider-key encryption may be locked. Enabling generates the key lazily and clears feed ETags so scheduled refreshes converge; feedUrl in the feeds API, the modified-mode OPML export, and episode processedUrl/vtt/chapters URLs all carry the key; the `podcast:guid` seed stays keyless so feed identity never changes. New endpoints: `POST /settings/feed-auth/regenerate-key` (rotate, 409 while disabled) and `POST /feeds/regenerate` (re-render every served RSS without re-discovering or queuing episodes, so it cannot trigger processing or touch stats). serve_rss also self-heals: a cached feed whose embedded key state mismatches the active key is force-rebuilt on its next authenticated fetch. Enabling or rotating requires re-adding feeds in podcast apps; the OPML export includes the key to ease that. The admin UI/API (`/api`, `/ui`) and `/health` are not gated. No Cloudflare rule changes needed: the cover URL still ends in `.jpg` and query strings are not part of the matched path.

## [2.32.5] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- The cover-art cache-bust token was a query string (`cover-minuspod.jpg?v=<hash>`), so the channel image URL did not end in a recognized image extension. Pocket Casts (and Apple) reject such artwork URLs and never fetch them, so the badged cover did not load even though the URL served 200. The token now lives in the path (`cover-minuspod-<hash>.jpg`), which ends in `.jpg`; a new `/<slug>/cover-minuspod-<token>.jpg` route (and its `/episodes/` alias) serves it, with the token ignored since the current variant always matches the current token. Cache-busting behavior and the Cloudflare `.jpg` allow rule are unchanged.

## [2.32.4] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Served feeds pointed the channel image at a static `/<slug>/cover-minuspod.jpg` URL, so podcast apps that cache cover art by URL (Pocket Casts, Apple) never re-fetched the badged art after a cover or badge change, even though `lastBuildDate` is regenerated on every render. The badged cover URL now carries a content-addressed `?v=` token (`storage.artwork_version`: an md5 of the source cover bytes folded with `cover_badge_salt`, the badge asset's own fingerprint plus a `BADGE_REVISION` constant). The token shifts when the cover bytes or the badge change and is stable otherwise, so apps re-pull only when the art actually changed; a cover re-hosted at the same URL is not re-downloaded by the existing `download_artwork` short-circuit, so it does not shift until the cover is actually re-fetched. The cached badge variant is also regenerated when it predates its cover or badge inputs, so a change reaches apps on the passive refresh path, not only via "Refresh all artwork". The `?v=` lives in the query string, which is not part of the request path, so the Cloudflare `.jpg` allow rule still matches.

## [2.32.3] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- LAN and localhost base URLs were classified as free by an address-locality heuristic, causing a paid Claude proxy on a LAN gateway to be treated as a zero-cost endpoint and skipping all pricing refreshes. Address locality no longer implies cost. A new `pricing_source_mode` setting (auto/litellm/free, default auto) lets operators declare intent explicitly; auto applies provider-based rules as before, free is the self-hosted escape hatch that the old heuristic tried to infer. Adds a regression test pinning that the source column updates correctly on upsert conflict.

## [2.32.2] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Pricing source resolution returns an ordered fallback chain instead of a single source, and unknown public openai-compatible domains fall to LiteLLM rather than being treated as free, so a pricing refresh is never permanently skipped (third incident of this class, after opus48-cost-fix and 1.0.79). Claude default pricing is now backfilled after every refresh when the provider is Anthropic or any configured model normalizes to a Claude key, regardless of fetch success. The cost prefix match refuses a version-crossing match when the next character after the matched prefix is a digit, so claude-opus-4-8 no longer prefix-matches claude-opus-4. Adds claude-sonnet-5 (3/15) and claude-fable-5 (10/50) defaults plus a one-time recompute of Sonnet 5 / Fable 5 calls previously recorded at $0.

## [2.32.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Stale processing state (current_job and queued display entries) left by a container restart is cleared at startup before the queue processor thread starts, resetting the interrupted episode to pending so it can be reprocessed (#452). A corrupt processing_status.json is now treated as empty and rewritten instead of misbehaving.

## [2.32.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Per-feed cue match threshold: feeds accept a cueTemplateScoreOverride (0.30-0.99) that beats the global audio_cue_template_score, and the threshold-suggest Apply button now writes this override instead of the global setting.
- Recurring cue suggestions are typed and ranked by how often their occurrences land on known ad boundaries (boundaryAffinity, adBoundaryHits, affinitySource); when the scanned episode has no ad history, up to two recent episodes are checked instead.
- Near-miss cue telemetry: template matches just under the threshold are recorded as below_threshold rows that never affect cuts, and unused detections carry a reason (covered, out of reach, below snap confidence, or a cue-pair skip reason) plus the distance to the nearest ad edge. The aggregate endpoint gains a near-miss histogram and reason counts.
- Saving an ad-break cue longer than 5s warns once that tight clips match better; a second Save keeps it.
- The detection prompt caps unlabelled (spectral) cues at 5 per window and frames them as weak hints; learned template cues are never capped.
- Offline cue eval harness (benchmarks/cues): sweep templates against real episodes, suggest thresholds, A/B formant attenuation, and score the discovery scan. First real-audio cue fixtures and matcher tests (tests/fixtures/cues).

### Changed

- Intro/outro cue suggestions can span up to the capture ceiling (previously hard-capped at 30s) and their edges are refined to roughly 0.1s.
- Boundary snap reaches farther (10s lead / 4s lag, both settings, range 0.5-30) and picks the nearest eligible cue instead of the highest-confidence one; when several cues are in reach, the reviewer is told.
- Cue lines in prompts show span and duration, not just a start time.
- Content-transition cues get the same framing in the detection and review passes: they may or may not sit at an ad boundary, and never force a cut on their own.
- The reviewer's cue-evidence radius follows review_max_boundary_shift instead of a hard 60s.

### Fixed

- The reviewer no longer describes spectral loudness bursts as ground-truth boundary markers.

## [2.31.7] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- On a wide screen the transport controls and the selection readout share one row instead of stacking, so the editor is not three lines tall. On mobile they still stack.

### Fixed

- The playback-speed picker closes on Escape without also closing the editor, dismisses on a touch outside it, and no longer advertises listbox semantics it did not implement.

## [2.31.6] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- The play-selection control shows its bracketed play glyph again ([ play ]) to read as "play the selection," matching the original design.

## [2.31.5] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- The transport bar is a compact pill centered in the editor instead of a full-width box, and the speed control is grouped next to the transport buttons instead of sitting at the far edge on a wide screen.

## [2.31.4] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- The playback speed control is a custom button with a small popover instead of a native dropdown. Native dropdowns render at their own size on iOS, so the control was oversized on iPhone; the custom button matches the transport buttons on every platform.

## [2.31.3] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- The transport controls use a three-column layout: the transport cluster is centered and the playback speed control sits in its own column on the right, so it is on the same line without overlapping the Stop button.

## [2.31.2] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- The playback speed control moved onto the transport row instead of dropping to its own line on a narrow screen.

## [2.31.1] - 2026-07-01

### Changed

- The cue editor's play-selection control is now a compact icon-only amber button, and the time readout is centered under the controls. The amber shifts a shade darker in light mode for contrast.
- The Add/Edit ad editor can now audition its selection: the same play-selection control plays only the marked ad span (start to end), matching the cue editor. Scrubbing, dragging a pin, or seeking during the audition ends it, so it never pauses playback you start afterward.

## [2.31.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- The cue editor's "Play selection" control is now a bracketed play icon in the
  main transport row, so it is easy to find. It plays only the bracketed
  selection (#350).
- Saved cues on a feed's Audio Cue Templates list now have a Play button so you
  can hear each one without exporting it. One cue plays at a time.
- New "Suggest threshold" tool on a feed's cue test panel: it sweeps a sample
  of episodes and proposes a global cue match threshold from the gap between
  noise and real matches. The tool notes that a cue below 0.80 confidence will
  not change cuts. The default match threshold stays 0.75 (#350).

### Changed

- Content-transition cues are now described to the ad reviewer as a
  maybe-boundary transition instead of being grouped with the show's intro or
  outro, so a jingle reused around ad breaks is no longer treated as
  never-a-boundary (#350).
- Cue-pair ad synthesis no longer invents an ad over show content on feeds
  whose single cue brackets both ends of a break with an unbracketed opening
  ad. Each cue is now oriented from the first-pass ad edges and paired on the
  right phase (#350).

### API

- `GET /api/v1/cue-templates/{templateId}/audio` -- streams the template's raw
  audio as `audio/wav` (404 unknown, 422 no audio stored).
- `POST /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/cue-threshold-suggest` -- runs a threshold sweep
  and returns `{episodeId, status, suggestion?, sampleEpisodes?, floorUsed?,
  perTemplate?, error?}`.

## [2.30.0] - 2026-07-01

A codebase-wide audit. Alongside the #449 fix it corrects a set of latent bugs
found by review, removes dead code, and adds the repo's first Python lint gate.

### Fixed

- The "Save" button in the ad editor now closes the editor on the last detected ad (#449). Saving the last ad previously looked like it did nothing: the correction was recorded, but the editor did not advance or close and showed no confirmation, so the change was easy to miss. It now closes the way "Skip" does at the end of the list, and the saved edit shows up in the marker list.
- Prevented a migration data-loss path: the one-time episodes-table rebuild used when tightening a status CHECK constraint recreated the table without the `original_file`, `processed_version`, `episode_number`, and `tags` columns, so an upgrade that hit the rebuild dropped their data. All four are now carried through the rebuild.
- Adding a feed with an invalid `maxEpisodes` or language override no longer leaves a half-created feed. Those values are validated before the podcast row is created, so a bad value returns 400 without persisting anything (and a retry no longer hits "already exists").
- Pattern deduplication now deletes the audio fingerprints of the removed duplicates instead of orphaning them; an orphaned fingerprint could still drive audio cuts against a pattern that no longer existed.
- Fixed a connection leak in the RSS fetcher and a file-descriptor leak in the queue's orphan-lock probe, both on specific error paths.
- Episode and search listings clamp a negative `limit` instead of letting it slip past the row cap.
- Saving ad-detection settings with a null API key clears the key instead of returning 500, and resetting those settings now also resets `whisper_language`.
- Short pattern templates that fall outside every TF-IDF window bucket are matched again instead of being silently skipped.
- 401/403/404 provider responses are no longer treated as retryable fallback candidates (retrying cannot fix them).
- Frontend: the login redirect no longer runs during render; ad timestamps no longer render `:60.0` when fractional seconds round up; the "show original transcript" preference no longer shares a `localStorage` key with a collapsible section; and per-row save feedback in the rejected-marker list no longer lights up unrelated rows.

### Changed

- Added a `ruff` lint job to CI, the repo's first automated Python lint gate, and cleaned up everything it flagged: unused imports, dead local variables, and empty f-strings across the backend and tests.
- The TF-IDF, fuzzy, and audio-fingerprint match thresholds now come from a single definition in `config.py`. The per-module copies that duplicated those values were removed so the two cannot drift apart.
- Consolidated the duplicated frontend clock and date formatters into `frontend/src/utils/format.ts`, and the list-page pagination controls into a shared `Pagination` component (Patterns, Sponsors, History).
- The status broadcaster logs a failing subscriber once at warning and then at debug, instead of silently swallowing the error or warning on every update.
- Performance: the text matcher reuses TF-IDF vectors built at load instead of re-vectorizing short templates per episode; feed rendering parses the upstream XML once instead of three times; re-detect no longer fetches the same podcast row twice.
- Robustness: non-security MD5 hashing is marked `usedforsecurity=False`, exception chaining was added to several raises, and the OpenAI error-classification path no longer crashes if a future SDK drops an error class.
- The detection-stage labels in the UI now cover all backend stages, and post-roll detection honors full-reprocess mode symmetrically with pre-roll.

### Removed

- Removed roughly 40 unused functions, methods, and classes across the backend and frontend: dead database helpers, transcriber and transcript methods, sponsor-service helpers, several unused API-client wrappers, and an ad-editor prop that was accepted but never read. No behavior change.
- Removed the `CleanupService` module, an unwired scheduled-backup and retention path that was never instantiated in production. Episode retention runs through `background.py`, and manual database backups via the API are unchanged.

### Documentation

- New [Audio Cue Detection](docs/audio-cues.md) guide. It pulls the cue content that was spread across the configuration, web-interface, and how-it-works docs into one page, and documents the "Find audio cues" scan (recurring stings plus intros and outros shared across a feed) that the prose docs never covered.
- Added a Features overview to the README, and linked the audio-cues and OpenVINO docs from its table and the docs index.
- Documented the cover-art badge and its `POST /api/v1/feeds/refresh-artwork` endpoint, chapter generation, and the Recut Audio reprocess mode.
- Corrected the reprocess-mode list (four modes from the episode menu, three in bulk), noted that the detection window size and overlap are configurable, and replaced the stale `2.8.13` version examples.
- Fixed API reference inaccuracies: the mode-aware reprocess endpoint is `/api/v1/episodes/{slug}/{id}/reprocess` (the `/feeds/...` path ignores `mode` and always runs a full reprocess), the cue-template create body takes `cueType` (not `label`), and the cue capture range is 0.2 to 10 seconds (up to 60 for a show intro or outro).
- Added the `GET /api/v1/tags/vocabulary` path to `openapi.yaml`.
- Refreshed every UI screenshot (desktop and mobile, dark theme) and added audio-cue and badged-cover-art images.

## [2.29.1] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- Numeric settings fields can be cleared and retyped. They were coerced on every keystroke, so you could not clear a 0, and typing into it produced "012" or "120" (worst on mobile). The Audio Cue Detection, Ad Reviewer, Transcription, and global-defaults fields now share an input that allows clearing and clamps on blur.
- The "Create ads from cue pairs" toggle now uses a one-line label like the others and only appears when audio cue detection is on (cue-pair synthesis needs the detector).

## [2.29.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Voiceover-robust cue matching (#350). A saved cue that is a music bed under a per-episode voiceover (e.g. the WSJ "The Journal" jingle) matched poorly across episodes because the voiceover varies. The new `audio_cue_formant_atten_db` setting (off by default) attenuates the 800-3400 Hz speech band during template matching so the cue keys on its constant bed. Only that band is touched, so bass beds and high stings are unaffected, and existing cues are unchanged until you enable it.

### Changed

- Recurring cue suggestions stop matching common spoken phrases (#350). The "Find audio cues" scan now drops candidates that read as speech (speech-band energy, not tonal, gappy) while keeping musical stings, even ones with a voiceover. Cross-episode intro/outro detection is unchanged; already-scanned episodes rescan once so the filter applies.
- The "Content transition" cue type is relabeled "Content transition (may or may not be an ad)", and its save dialog no longer calls the segment not-an-ad (#350). It is still never cut on its own; only the wording changed (the model prompt was already correct).
- "Re-detect Ads" (re-run detection on the saved transcript) now appears for failed episodes that still have a transcript, not just completed ones (#349). The backend already allowed it; the button was gated on the regenerated VTT, which a failed run never produces.

### Security

- Bumped `@babel/core` to 7.29.7 (GHSA-4x5r-pxfx-6jf8, build-time dev dependency) and `brace-expansion` to 5.0.7; `npm audit` is clean (#27).

## [2.28.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Per-pass prompt overrides (#429). Each pass (first, verification, reviewer, resurrect) gets an optional override field in Settings, empty by default. Text there is added to that pass at run time, so you can tweak a pass without editing the built-in prompt; an empty override changes nothing. Put `{override}` in a customized prompt to control placement, otherwise it is appended.

### Changed

- Cleaner Gemini/429 handling (#435). A failed review no longer leaks the raw provider payload into the ad editor; it shows a short "Review unavailable" note while the full error stays in the logs. A 429 with a retry delay in its body (as Gemini sends) is honored for backoff, and free-tier daily-quota exhaustion fails fast instead of retrying a quota that cannot recover until tomorrow.
- Updated dependencies: openai 2.44.0, anthropic 0.112.0, huggingface-hub 1.21.0, nh3 0.3.6; frontend recharts 3.9.0, lucide-react 1.22.0, swagger-ui-dist 5.32.8, @typescript-eslint/parser 8.62.0, globals 17.7.0; CI actions/cache 6.1.0 and actions/setup-python 6.3.0.

## [2.27.3] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- Cue suggestion markers are visible in the capture tool again. They load when the tool opens (instead of only after a separate scan) and render as labeled shaded spans across each candidate's full length, rather than unlabeled ticks pinned to the episode edges that read as missing when a scan returned only an intro or outro.

### Changed

- The "Find audio cues" scan surfaces up to three recurring intros and three outros a feed shares across episodes, not just one of each, so a show with both a theme and a recurring sponsor read shows both. It also skips any sound already captured as a cue template, so the scan only suggests new cues.
- Saving a cue as a non-ad type (show intro, show outro, or content transition) now requires confirming it is the show's own audio and not an ad. These types are exempt from cutting, and a recurring segment at an episode's start or end is often a pre-roll or post-roll ad, so the confirmation stops a recurring ad from being marked non-ad and left in.

## [2.27.2] - 2026-06-28

### Changed

- The "Find audio cues" scan now finds intros and outros by comparing the episode against recent completed episodes, replacing the one-off loud-spot pass added in 2.27.0. That pass surfaced short bursts of loud dialogue rather than cues (on one episode 19 of 20 suggestions were 0.6-to-2.3-second blips), because a real intro or outro plays once per episode and the within-episode recurrence scan cannot see it. The scan now fingerprints the episode's first three minutes and last two minutes and looks for a segment that also appears near the start or end of the five most recent completed episodes; a segment is suggested as an intro or outro only when it recurs in at least two of them. Within-episode recurring stings (ad breaks) are still found and listed alongside.

### Fixed

- A failed dependency install no longer ships a broken image. The Dockerfile ran the pip install and a cache-cleanup step in one chain ending in `|| true`, so a pip failure exited zero and the build succeeded without the dependencies; one such build shipped an image with no gunicorn that crash-looped on deploy. The install is now its own step that fails the build, with the cleanup separated out. Mirrored in the CPU Dockerfile.

## [2.27.1] - 2026-06-28

### Changed

- Renamed the audio-cue capture action to "Find audio cues" (from "Find cue candidates") in both the episode panel and the capture tool, and the panel section is now titled "Audio Cues".

## [2.27.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- The cue candidate scan now surfaces one-off intros, outros, and bumpers, not just sounds that repeat across an episode. It combines the recurrence scan with a loud-spot pass and tags each candidate with a positional cue-type hint (intro near the start, outro near the end) that the capture tool preselects. Candidate length now reaches the longest per-type ceiling (60 seconds for intro and outro), so a long stinger is captured in full instead of being clipped to the 10-second ad-break limit.

### Changed

- Cue templates export as a lossless FLAC instead of an uncompressed WAV, which roughly halves the shared file. Import accepts both the new FLAC packs and older WAV packs, and still recomputes the MFCC from the audio rather than trusting a shared feature blob.

### Fixed

- The transcription model no longer invents sponsor names such as "Wegovy, Ozempic, Mounjaro" in silent gaps. Those names were seeded into the vocabulary hint given to Whisper, and on quiet audio Whisper echoed the hint back into the transcript verbatim; the ad detector then cut those gaps as ad breaks on shows that never ran the ad. The drug names and other bare common-English words (calm, indeed, audible) are no longer seeded, so Whisper is not primed to emit them and the scrubber no longer deletes real speech that uses those words. The hint and the prompt-leakage scrubber are now built from one shared list so they cannot drift, and the scrubber removes an echoed run of sponsor names at any length while leaving a genuine sponsor mention (one with real speech around the brand) intact.

## [2.26.0] - 2026-06-27

### Changed

- An instance with no app password set is now fully functional, the same as one with a password. Before this, the API blocked feed deletion, system maintenance, and the database backup with a 403 until a password was set, so you could add feeds but not delete them, and the dashboard swallowed the error so the delete appeared to do nothing (issue #431). The password is now the only gate on the API: set one under Settings > Security to protect the instance, or run without one and accept that it is fully open.

### Security

- A no-password instance is unprotected: anyone who can reach it can read everything, change settings, delete feeds, and download a full database backup over the API. With `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` unset, that backup includes the session-signing key and provider keys in plaintext. Set a password before exposing the instance. This reverts the pre-bootstrap restrictions added in 2.6.0.

### Fixed

- The dashboard now surfaces an error when a feed delete or refresh fails, instead of silently doing nothing (issue #431).
- The Set Password field's minimum-length check now matches the server at 12 characters; it previously allowed 9-to-11 character values the server then rejected.

## [2.25.2] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- The badged cover art is served from a podcast-level path, `/<slug>/cover-minuspod.jpg`, and the feed points its channel image there. It was under `/episodes/<slug>/`, which read as episode-scoped and which Pocket Casts did not pick up after the badge changed, since it caches channel art by URL and re-fetches only when the URL changes. The new URL makes apps re-fetch. The old `/episodes/<slug>/cover-minuspod.jpg` path stays as an alias so apps that cached it keep working. Per-episode covers are unchanged and still come from the source feed.

## [2.25.1] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- "Refresh all artwork" now actually replaces an existing cover-art badge. The refresh re-pulled each cover but skipped the badge regeneration when the cover was already cached, which is the common case, so a new badge could never reach feeds that already had one. The refresh now drops the cached badge so it recomposites with the current rendering and the current toggle (issue #420).

## [2.25.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Previous/next feed controls on the feed page, next to "Back to Dashboard". They follow the dashboard's current sort, so right and left step to the feeds shown on either side of this one without going back to the list. The labels read "Newer"/"Older" when the dashboard is sorted by recent activity and "Prev"/"Next" when it is sorted A-Z (issue #417).

### Fixed

- The cover-art badge stays visible on dark and busy cover art. It was the MinusPod waveform on a transparent background, so it washed out against anything that was not light. It now sits on a dark rounded chip with a thin light ring and a soft shadow. Re-run "Refresh all artwork" (or wait for the next feed refresh) after upgrading so the new badge replaces the cached one.

## [2.24.2] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- The cover-art badge now reaches podcast apps. The served feed pointed its channel image at the `/api/v1` artwork endpoint, which the public feed host blocks (403), so apps never fetched the badged cover. The badge is now served from `/episodes/<slug>/cover-minuspod.jpg` -- the same public path the feed already uses for audio and transcripts. Re-run "Refresh all artwork" (or wait for the next feed refresh) after upgrading.

## [2.24.1] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- A "Refresh all artwork" button under Settings -> Output -> Cover Art, plus a `POST /feeds/refresh-artwork` endpoint. It re-pulls each feed's cover and rebuilds the served feeds so a change to the cover-art badge setting shows up, without re-discovering or queuing episodes -- so it never starts processing. Your podcast app still re-fetches the feed on its own schedule.

### Changed

- Settings and episode pages now hide a card's description while the card is collapsed, so collapsed sections show just their title.

## [2.24.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Previous/next episode controls on the episode page, next to "Back to Feed". They follow the feed's newest-first order -- right goes to the older episode, left to the newer one -- so you can move between adjacent episodes without going back to the feed list (issue #417).
- An optional MinusPod badge on served cover art. Turn it on under Settings -> Output -> Cover Art and the feed's channel art gets a small badge in the bottom-right corner, so the filtered version is easy to tell apart from the original in a podcast app. Off by default (issue #420).

## [2.23.1] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- Settings search now highlights matching text in yellow as you type, the same as the global search page. Type "llm" and every match in the open sections is marked.

### Changed

- Audio editor: the play controls sit centered on their own row, and the cue duration moved up onto the selection readout line instead of trailing below the time fields.
- The ad-editor waveform now follows the theme primary color at rest, matching the cue waveform. It was rendering muted grey while the cue capture was green; both come from one shared color now, so they cannot drift apart again.

## [2.23.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- A "Content transition" cue template type. Some shows reuse one jingle across non-ad transitions (intro, exit from an ad, segment changes, outro). Marking that jingle as an ad-break start or end would snap an ad boundary onto every occurrence, including the ones that are not ads. The new type instead tells the model a transition happens there without claiming an ad, so it stays a hint and never forces a cut. Pick it from the cue type dropdown (issue #350).

### Changed

- Zooming the cue-marking waveform now keeps the playhead centered (Audacity-style) instead of holding the old scroll position. The ad editor's waveform got the same change, and both now share one window/zoom implementation, so the two editors behave the same and there is one place to maintain (issue #350).

## [2.22.1] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Recut no longer regenerates chapters, so it makes no AI calls and costs nothing. Chapter titling runs a topic-boundary model pass, which slipped an LLM call (a few cents) into what is meant to be a pure ffmpeg re-cut. Recut now leaves the existing chapters in place; refresh them with the Regenerate Chapters action when you want new ones (issue #422).

## [2.22.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- A "Recut audio" reprocess option. After editing an episode's ad detections (reject, manually add, adjust boundaries), recut takes the retained original audio and cuts a fresh version from your current edits, then re-times the saved transcript and chapters to match. It skips transcription and all AI calls, so it is fast and free; it just needs the original audio to have been kept. Lives in the existing reprocess menu on the episode page (issue #422).
- The log warns when a login happens over plain HTTP while `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` is on (the default). In that setup the browser drops the Secure session cookie, so the login returns 200 but the next request is unauthenticated and the UI bounces back to the login screen with nothing in the log to explain it. The warning names the fix: set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false` for plain HTTP, or serve over HTTPS. It stays quiet when `BASE_URL` is https, since there the request only looks insecure because TLS was terminated upstream (issue #423).

### Documentation

- Dropped `APP_PASSWORD` from the docs. The code no longer reads it anywhere; the UI password is set in Settings > Security and kept in the database. The docs still listed it as the way to seed the initial password, which sent people down a dead end (issue #423).

## [2.21.0] - 2026-06-24

### Fixed

- Retention now sweeps episodes that were processed before the completion time was being recorded. The cleanup compared each episode's `processed_at` against the cutoff, but a long run of episodes finished without that field ever being set, and in SQL a comparison against a missing value is never true, so the sweep skipped them: a 30-day setting still had four-month-old audio on disk. Processing now records the completion time on every episode it finalizes, and for older rows that never got one the sweep falls back to the episode's last-updated time, so both groups age out. That fallback time is bumped by a reprocess or a metadata edit, so an older un-recorded episode touched recently can outlast its window until it is processed again.

### Changed

- The "Keep original audio" setting says what it is actually for. The label and help text described it as ad-boundary review only, but the retained original also drives the audio cue tools and reprocessing, so the copy now names all three uses.

### Documentation

- The web interface guide documents the editable per-feed display title: it rewrites the served feed's `<title>` for subscribers while leaving the source title alone.

## [2.20.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- The settings page has a search box. As the page has grown it got harder to find a specific toggle, so there is now a filter at the top (above Appearance, below the processing queue) that narrows the page as you type. It matches a section's title or any of the setting labels inside it, hides the rest, and expands what is left; clearing it puts everything back. Client-side only, no backend calls. Thanks to the request in #416.

### Changed

- The "Find cue candidates" scan's similarity floor dropped from 0.75 to 0.73. On a real ad-break sting whose occurrences vary a little (codec or level jitter), one or two copies were landing just under 0.75 and getting dropped from the count; 0.73 catches them. A threshold sweep showed 0.72 to 0.75 behave the same on a clean episode and 0.70 is a noise cliff (the candidate list triples and a non-ad sound nearly ties the real sting), so 0.73 is the headroom without the noise.

## [2.19.0] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- The "Find cue candidates" scan now finds recurring sounds by fingerprinting the whole episode instead of hunting for loud spots. The old pass only triggered on loud bursts, so it missed ad-break stings that play at the same level as the talking around them. On one Daily Tech News Show episode the recurring sting sits at or below the speech level at most of its appearances, and the loud-spot pass returned nothing usable. The new scan generates one Chromaprint fingerprint of the episode and surfaces the windows that repeat across it, which does not depend on loudness: on that same episode it now returns the sting as the top candidate (5 of its 6 appearances) plus two other recurring segments, in about two seconds. Candidates are ranked by how often they repeat.

### Added

- Marking an ad-break cue now warns when the sound does not repeat in its source episode. A cue that appears only once can never bracket a break, so on save the capture tool checks the new cue against the rest of the episode; if an ad-break cue occurs just once, it asks you to pick a sound that repeats, or to click Save again to keep it anyway. Show intro and outro cues are skipped, since they are meant to play once.

### Fixed

- Cue-pair ad synthesis no longer invents an ad that covers most of a short episode. Two cues far enough apart could bracket a span that passed the absolute maximum-break limit (480s) yet still covered most of a short show, producing a phantom ad. A pair whose span is more than half the episode is now rejected; the fraction is a new tunable setting (audio_cue_pair_max_break_fraction, default 0.5, 0 to disable).

## [2.18.2] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Ad markers no longer show one sponsor's name with a different ad's description. When two detection stages overlapped, the cross-stage merge took the sponsor from one and the reason from the other, so a text-pattern match that fired on the wrong content (a Nordstrom pattern landing on a host tour-promo) or two back-to-back reads for different sponsors (a David Protein read next to a ZipRecruiter read) produced a self-contradictory marker. The merge now takes the sponsor and reason from the same member, preferring the content-aware (more descriptive) one, so the label always matches the description.
- The play button on cue matches works again. When the original audio's metadata had not loaded yet, clicking did nothing: the handler waited for a load it never triggered, and even when it did fire it called play() outside the click's user gesture, which the browser blocks. It now starts playback synchronously on the click (keeping the gesture and triggering the load) and seeks to the match once metadata is ready. The same fix is applied to the cue-candidate preview button.

### Dependencies

- Bumped anthropic (0.109.2 -> 0.111.0), openai (2.41.0 -> 2.43.0), huggingface-hub (1.19.0 -> 1.20.1), pytest (9.1.0 -> 9.1.1); frontend react-router-dom (7.17.0 -> 7.18.0), lucide-react (1.18.0 -> 1.21.0), eslint (10.4.0 -> 10.5.0), typescript-eslint and @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin (8.61.1); and actions/checkout (v6.0.3 -> v7.0.0).

## [2.18.1] - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- The text-pattern ad detector no longer cuts show content along with an ad. It was placing a single marker that ran from the real ad back through minutes of preceding show audio (one episode lost about 6 minutes of basketball talk before a Hims/Quince read). The matcher built each marker from every fragment it matched with no length limit, so a wrong early anchor or a chained merge could stretch one marker across unrelated content. Now a text-pattern marker longer than the longest plausible single read (3 min) is trimmed to where the sponsor name is actually spoken, matched as a whole word so "Hims" no longer matches "whims". An over-long span with no sponsor mention, or one that can't be attributed, is dropped rather than cut, and different sponsors stay as separate markers instead of merging into one giant span.

## [2.18.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Cue candidates can be previewed inline. Each candidate in the "Find cue candidates" list now has a play button that plays just that sound's span, so you can hear it before deciding to make a template. Previously the only way to hear a candidate was to open the capture tool. Playing another candidate, or clicking the same one again, stops the current preview.

## [2.17.0] - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- The "Find cue candidates" scan now uses a more generous discovery profile so it surfaces the sustained, bass/broadband musical stings real ad breaks use, not just short high-pitched dings. It reaches lower in frequency (500Hz, vs the 1.5kHz live floor), triggers on a smaller rise above the baseline, captures each sound's full attack and decay instead of just the loud middle, and allows long sounds (up to 12s, where live detection caps at 2s). The recurrence filter (a sound must repeat to be suggested) still removes one-off noise, and live cue detection is unchanged. Candidate loud-spots are now kept by strength rather than by time, so a recurring sting late in an episode is not crowded out of the cap.

### Fixed

- The Ad Distribution chart no longer logs a recharts width(-1)/height(-1) warning: its collapsible section now mounts the chart only when opened, so it never renders into a zero-size collapsed container.
- Added the standard `<meta name="mobile-web-app-capable">` tag alongside the deprecated apple-prefixed one.

## [2.16.0] - 2026-06-20

### Changed

- Community pattern sync now uses a thin manifest index instead of embedding every pattern inline. Each index entry carries a content hash and a file path; the client fetches only the per-pattern files whose hash is new or changed, so a routine sync transfers almost nothing and the index stays small as the catalog grows (44 KB now, where the inline manifest was 190 KB and rising). The update gate is the content hash rather than the version number, so a reverted pattern re-syncs. Clients still read the older inline manifest during rollout, and the protected-from-sync and anti-mass-delete guards are unchanged.

### Added

- content_hash column on ad_patterns (additive migration, no data loss). Existing community rows have no hash until the first sync after upgrade, which re-fetches each pattern once to populate it, then stays quiet.

## [2.15.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Pattern merge now folds near-duplicate same-sponsor patterns into one row. The kept pattern keeps its own text; the others' intro/outro phrases are added to it as variants, deduped and capped at five per side. The Patterns page shows merge suggestions for same-sponsor patterns that read like the same ad, and you can drop individual rows before folding. Merging different sponsors is blocked. Merging reads that are less than 75 percent similar is allowed but warns first.

### Changed

- Manually created patterns now get intro/outro variants derived from their text instead of starting empty, so they get the same boundary placement as auto-created patterns.
- Auto-promotion unions variants through the same shared helper, so a promoted pattern's variant arrays are deduped and bounded instead of growing without limit.
- Raised the community manifest size cap from 256 KB to 1 MB. The manifest still embeds every pattern inline, so it grows with the catalog and had reached about 74 percent of the old cap. This is an interim bump; a thin index with incremental fetch is the durable fix and is tracked for a follow-up.

### Fixed

- Merging patterns now deletes the folded rows' audio fingerprints instead of leaving them orphaned. A fingerprint is the audio hash of that row's specific read, so it must not outlive the row or attach to a different one.

## [2.14.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Show-intro and show-outro cue capture maximums are now tuneable in Settings -> Audio Cue Detection, under Advanced tuning, with one field each. They were fixed at 60s in code, so a feed with a longer show intro or a shorter outro had no way to change the ceiling. Both default to 60s and accept 0.05 to 120s; the server reads the matching setting when you bracket an intro or outro stinger.

### Changed

- The default "Capture maximum length (s)" for cues is now 10s, raised from 4s. This is the ceiling for ad-break cues; a feed that already saved its own value keeps it. Show intro and outro stingers use their own higher, tuneable ceilings.

### Fixed

- "Reset all settings to defaults" now resets the Audio Cue Detection settings. The reset endpoint already listed them, but the database reset map did not, so each call was a silent no-op (the same gap that was fixed for the reviewer prompts earlier). Every audio cue value now reverts to its default on reset.
- Numeric ad-detection settings now reject a NaN value. JSON parsing accepts NaN, and a NaN passed both ends of the range check, so it could be stored and then poison later comparisons. The validator now requires a finite number.

## [2.13.1] - 2026-06-20

### Changed

- When keep-content mode falls back to normal ad removal, the log now says why. The old line just printed the content-span count, so a fallback was opaque. It now names the gate that tripped (coverage, removed fraction, or a single cut too long) and prints the numbers behind it (coverage, removed fraction, longest cut), plus a per-window content-span count so you can see which window the model under-labeled. No behavior change; this is logging only.

## [2.13.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Keep-content detection mode, opt-in per feed (Feed settings -> Detection). It is for feeds whose ads are dynamically inserted and keep changing, so there is no stable ad to match. Instead of asking the model which spans are ads, it asks which spans are the show, then removes everything else. It defaults off; every feed keeps the normal ad-removal behavior unless you switch it on. The mode is experimental and guarded: if the model labels too little of the episode as content, the removal would cut too much, a single cut runs too long, or a content pass comes back empty, the feed falls back to normal ad removal for that episode. The guards catch the gross cases but can still miss a single mislabeled stretch, so check episodes before trusting it on a feed.

## [2.12.2] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- The cue-capture waveform no longer goes blank when you zoom in, especially near the end of a long episode. It used to render the whole episode as one giant canvas and zoom by widening it, but the waveform library stops drawing past about 16000 pixels, so the zoomed-in far end showed nothing. Zooming now narrows the rendered span to about one screen-width and a full-episode scrubber lets you pan, so the waveform stays drawn at any zoom while keeping the whole-episode view at 1x.

### Changed

- Hardened the auto-process queue: the next episode is now claimed atomically (a single conditional update) instead of selected and then marked, so the dequeue stays correct even if a second queue worker is ever added. No behavior change with the current single worker.

## [2.12.1] - 2026-06-20

### Fixed

- Marking a long intro or outro no longer snaps the selection back to the 4s ad-break limit. "Set start/end at playhead" stopped clamping the length while you work; the length is checked only when you save, against the limit for the chosen cue type (60s for intro/outro, 4s for ad-break cues), with an inline note if it is out of range.

## [2.12.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- A network template now shows up on every feed in its network. Promote a cue to network scope on one feed and it appears in the cue-templates panel of each sibling feed, marked read-only there (you manage it from the feed that made it).

### Changed

- "Find recurring sounds" no longer times out on long episodes. The scan decodes the whole episode, which takes a minute or more on a two-hour show, so it now runs in the background and the panel polls until it is done instead of holding the request open until the proxy gives up with a 504.
- Renamed the cue-match outcome "Unused" to "LLM cue". These cues were sent to the model as evidence and often shaped a boundary; they just did not trigger the mechanical edge-snap, so "unused" read as if they were ignored. The badge tooltip now explains each outcome.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-06-20

### Added

- Custom networks are now selectable on other feeds. Set a custom network on one feed and it shows up in the Network dropdown on every other feed, so you can group same-creator shows without retyping the name. The `/networks` endpoint returns custom networks alongside the known ones.
- A play button on each cue match. Audition the matched audio before you confirm or reject it; one match plays at a time.

### Changed

- The mark-cue dialog shares its transport bar and zoom control with the ad editor, so the two look and behave the same. Zoom is a slider now, and the playback controls fit on a phone.

### Fixed

- Auditioning a cue no longer starts from 0:00 when you click before the audio metadata has loaded. It waits for the metadata, then plays the right window.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Manual networks. Some feeds share a creator but have no network, so auto-detect cannot link them. You can now set a custom network on a feed under Feed settings -> Network -> Custom network, and feeds with the same name form a network. Once a feed has a network, "Promote to network" in the cue-template panel applies a cue to every feed on it. Cue matching uses the override network first, then the auto-detected one.

### Changed

- Show intro and outro cues capture up to 60s (was 10s). Some outros run longer than the old cap allowed; ad-break cues stay at 4s.
- The mark-cue dialog matches the ad editor: the same transport bar (skip, rewind, play, stop, speed), the same time-input behavior, and outside clicks no longer close it.
- The capture dialog finds recurring sounds on demand instead of scanning loud spots on open. Its markers are the sounds that repeat across the episode, each labeled with its repeat count.
- The two episode cue sections are renamed and reordered. "Cue Matches" (confirm or reject each template match) sits above "Cue Candidates" (scan for a recurring sound to template), and opens by default when a match is waiting on a verdict.

### Fixed

- Time codes typed into the mark-cue Start and End fields no longer reset; a trailing ".0" sticks.
- The play/pause button no longer stays on pause after the audio finishes, and "Play selection" no longer pauses later playback at the end pin.
- A blank network override stored as an empty string no longer hides a feed's auto-detected network from cue matching.

## [2.10.5] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- The Detected Cues panel no longer lists every loud burst. An episode has dozens of one-off loud moments (laughs, music, applause) and they were drowning out the real cues. The panel now shows template matches plus a "Find cue candidates" scan that clusters the audio's loud bursts by sound and suggests only the ones that repeat, since a real ad-break ding recurs while a laugh does not. Spectral one-offs are no longer auto-listed. Two new tunables, `audio_cue_recurrence_similarity` and `audio_cue_recurrence_min_count`. New endpoint `GET /feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episode_id}/cue-candidates`.

## [2.10.4] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- Audited and shortened user-facing text. Docs went through a humanizer pass (sentence-case headings, plainer wording, no marketing tone), UI labels and descriptions were tightened, and several error messages were made clearer.

## [2.10.3] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- The Detected Cues panel hung for 25 to 75 seconds. The endpoint re-decoded the whole episode to run the loud-spot detector on every open. It now reads back the cues already found during processing, so the panel loads instantly. Loud-spot scanning stays in the capture tool, where it runs on an explicit action.

## [2.10.2] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- The Detected Cues panel now shows 10 candidates at a time with a "Load more" button, instead of rendering the full list (up to 100) at once. Keeps noisy feeds scannable.

## [2.10.1] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- Detected Cues panel on the episode page. Since the whole episode is already analyzed, it lists the candidate ad-break sounds found in the audio (persisted template and spectral cues plus template-free loud spots, labeled by source) and lets you promote any one into a per-feed cue template. "Make template" opens the capture tool pre-seeded with that sound's bounds, where you pick the cue type and save. This is a faster way to seed a feed's first template than hunting on the waveform. Backed by `GET /feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episode_id}/detected-cues`.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Cue-pair synthesis over-flagged a reprocessed episode into 42 ads, cutting a 61-minute show to 19 minutes. With `audio_cue_create_from_pairs` on, the synthesizer paired every `audio_cue` signal, including the coarse spectral fallback's. On a feed with no cue templates a dense burst of spectral cues paired into dozens of overlapping junk spans. Synthesis and boundary snap now act only on precise template cues; spectral cues stay prompt evidence and never mint or move a cut. Synthesized spans also dedup against each other, not just against the LLM's ads, so a clustered cue list can no longer produce overlapping duplicates.

### Added

- Cue Detections panel on the episode page. It lists every template cue the matcher surfaced, with the match score and how detection used the cue (paired into an ad, snapped an edge, or unused), and a confirm/reject verdict. Verdicts are advisory template-quality signals and never change the cut. The rows live in a new `cue_detections` table created automatically on upgrade.
- Per-feed cue health on the feed page: match-score range, confirm rate, and paired/snapped counts, so you can judge a feed's cues before enabling cue-pair synthesis. The same data is available in aggregate via `GET /cue-detections/aggregate` for threshold tuning.
- Intro/outro positional anchoring. The first show-intro cue marks where content starts and the last show-outro marks where it ends; the detector and reviewer treat audio before the first intro or after the last outro as more likely a pre/post-roll ad. It is a prompt bias, not an automatic cut.
- Show-intro and show-outro cues can be captured up to 10 seconds (ad-break types stay at 4), since station idents and theme stings run longer than a break ding.

### Changed

- The Rejected Detections list on the episode page is collapsed by default.
- A Docs link sits next to the existing API Docs link on the Settings page, pointing at the project documentation.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- Audio-cue UI was built desktop-only and broke on phones: the templates-panel header collapsed the description to one word per line and clipped the action buttons, the per-cue row actions overflowed the viewport, and the mark-cue modal controls crammed together. Reworked the panel and modal to be mobile-first (stacking, wrapping, full-width tap targets) while staying inline on desktop, and tightened the wordy cue copy across the panel, modal, episode picker, and settings hints. Frontend only; no API or schema change.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Container failed to boot on 2.9.0: `src/api/cue_templates.py` imported `version` at module top level, but `version.py` sits at the repo root and gunicorn runs from `/app/src`, so the repo root is not on `sys.path` in the container and every worker crashed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'version'`. Tests passed because pytest puts the repo root on the path. Now uses the existing container-safe `_get_version()` helper, matching how the rest of `src/` reads the version. 2.9.0 should not be deployed.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Per-podcast audio-cue templates (#350). The 2.8.6 cue detector flagged any short loudness burst in a frequency band; it could not tell one show's clink from another's swoosh and learned nothing across episodes. This release lets you mark the exact sound once on an episode waveform. The server stores its MFCC fingerprint (plus the raw PCM as a source of truth) and a normalized cross-correlation matcher finds that sound on every later episode, regardless of the band knobs. Templates take precedence per feed: when a feed has at least one enabled template the spectral detector is bypassed for that feed; otherwise it stays as the fallback. Both run only when the existing `audio_cue_detection_enabled` experiment is on.
- Each match feeds the first-pass detector as an `audio_cue` signal (the model still has to find the ad copy in the transcript), and a boundary-snap pass shifts the start and end edges of an LLM-detected ad to the nearest high-confidence cue, capped by the reviewer's max boundary shift, so the cut lands on the chime instead of a beat into the spoken read.
- Each cue has a type chosen from a fixed dropdown rather than a free-text label, so the phrase the model sees stays consistent. The type also sets the matching role: ad-break start snaps only an ad's start, ad-break end only its end, ad-break boundary either, and show intro/outro never move a boundary (they tell the model the sound is the show's open/close, not an ad). The role gating also stops two break-entry stingers from being paired into a span that would cover the content between two separate breaks.
- Opt-in cue-pair gap-filling (`audio_cue_create_from_pairs`, off by default): when an ad-break start cue and a later end (or boundary) cue bracket a plausible break the LLM missed, a cue-only ad is synthesized for that span. It still goes through the reviewer. Nothing in this feature cuts without the LLM.
- Capture and management UI on the feed detail page: bracket a 0.2 to 4 second cue on an episode's original-audio waveform with a snap-to-onset assist, pick a cue type, save and preview the matches, then manage templates (enable, change type, delete) and run a diagnostic scan against any episode.
- Local export and import: a template exports as a zip (a lossless WAV plus a JSON manifest) and imports into another install, where the MFCC is recomputed from the WAV. Two scope tiers, podcast and network, let a network reuse one cue across its shows.

### Notes

- Capture requires an episode's retained original audio, because a cue can sit inside a removed ad. `keep_original_audio` defaults to on; there is no backfill, so only episodes processed after this upgrade can be used to mark a cue. Storing raw PCM per template adds a small amount of disk (a 4 second 16 kHz mono cue is about 128 KB).

## [2.8.15] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- Ad detection now recovers ads when the model wraps a break in a `{"ad_break_index": N, "ads": [...]}` envelope instead of emitting them flat (#395). The envelope has no top-level start/end, so the per-ad parser previously discarded the whole break (seen in prod as "found 0 ads" for the affected window). Such envelopes are flattened to their inner ad objects before parsing.

## [2.8.14] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Obsidian theme (#385, by @SimpleHonors): a true-black OLED dark theme in the "Other" group with a cyan accent. Dark-only, like the other true-black themes, and tuned so the near-black background saves power on OLED panels.
- Parallel chunked transcription for remote API whisper backends (#388, by @SimpleHonors). Long episodes split into chunks that transcribe concurrently through a thread pool instead of one at a time, then merge in chronological order so overlap zones dedupe exactly as the sequential path does. Gated to the API backend; the local-model path is unchanged. Three DB-backed tunables (max chunk seconds, concurrent chunks, chunk overlap) with a Transcription settings panel shown only for the API backend. Maintainer follow-up clamped the tunables at the point of use so env-var or direct-DB values can't thread-bomb or break the merge dedupe.
- Optional audio loudness leveling (#386, by @SimpleHonors). A separate `dynaudnorm` ffmpeg pass evens out loudness on the final output, run after the verification pass so the cut graph and ad-detection analyzers still see uncompressed dynamics. Off by default; on failure the un-normalized output is kept (no data loss). Five intensity presets surfaced in the Audio settings section. Maintainer follow-up set the default-when-enabled to `normal` (safer than `aggressive` for spoken word).

### Fixed

- Pattern import/export dialogs now follow the active theme (#389, by @SimpleHonors). They had hardcoded `bg-white dark:bg-slate-900` containers and `text-slate-*` text, so they rendered with the wrong colors on any theme other than the default light/dark pair. They now use `bg-card`, `text-card-foreground`, `border-border`, and `text-muted-foreground`, and the action buttons moved off a hardcoded `bg-blue-600` to `bg-primary` so they pick up the theme color like the rest of the app.
- Scrollbars now follow the active theme instead of falling back to the default light system scrollbar (#389). The rules sit in `@layer base` so the `.no-scrollbar` utility still hides scrollbars where applied; an earlier unlayered version overrode it and left a thin scrollbar in Firefox on elements meant to have none.

### Changed

- Bumped `anthropic` to 0.109.2 (#372) and the `@typescript-eslint/parser` dev dependency to 8.61.1 (#369).

### Docs

- New Intel GPU transcription guide using OpenVINO Model Server (#364), linked from the transcription page. Also a docs accuracy pass against the code and removal of the obsolete 1.x to 2.0 upgrade notes (#382).

## [2.8.13] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- Feed detail page cleanup. The title's edit (pencil) icon is now always shown instead of only appearing on hover, so it can be tapped on touch devices. The Tags section starts collapsed. The per-feed controls that used to fill the header (network/DAI override, feed cap, auto-process, transcription language, and hide-unprocessed) now live in a "Feed settings" section that starts collapsed, pulled out into its own component to match the other feed panels.

## [2.8.12] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Editable feed title (#375). Each feed's detail page now has an inline title editor: rename a show and the new title is what subscribers see in their podcast app, so a MinusPod-processed feed is easy to tell apart from the source. The override survives RSS refreshes (the source title used to overwrite any manual edit), and clearing it falls back to the source title. Exposed as titleOverride on the feeds API.

### Security

- Bumped cryptography to 49.0.0, clearing GHSA-537c-gmf6-5ccf (the advisory pip-audit flagged on 48.0.0).

### Changed

- Swept the open dependency updates: anthropic 0.109.1, huggingface-hub 1.19.0, idna 3.18, pytest 9.1.0, and the frontend dev/lib bumps (typescript-eslint and @typescript-eslint/parser 8.61.0, @vitejs/plugin-react 6.0.2, @tailwindcss/vite 4.3.1, lucide-react 1.18.0).

## [2.8.11] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- Per-feed transcription language override (#376). A new Language control on the feed detail page sets the Whisper language for a single show, overriding the global setting. Useful when you mix languages and "auto-detect (multilingual)" transcribes the wrong language or translates instead of transcribing. Choices are "Global default", "Auto-detect", or a specific language. The override is threaded through first-pass and verification transcription without mutating shared settings, and learned ad patterns are stamped with the feed's language so multi-lingual setups do not cross-contaminate the pattern database. (PR #377, authored by @ict.)

## [2.8.10] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- Ad Distribution panel on the feed detail page (#360), collapsed by default under the tags section. It charts where ads have historically been cut across a feed's episodes (a normalized-position histogram) and highlights the learned prior zones on it, so you can see a show's ad pattern at a glance and decide whether the learned-positions experiment is worth enabling. The panel is informational and shows for every feed regardless of the experiment toggle, backed by a new GET /feeds/{slug}/ad-distribution endpoint.

## [2.8.9] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Learned ad positions experiment (#360), off by default. When enabled in Settings, each feed's historical cut starts (minus user-marked false positives, plus user-created and confirmed cuts) are clustered into per-feed ad-break zones once the feed has at least 5 learnable episodes (processed, over 60 seconds, with usable cut history) among its most recent 30. The zones feed the first-pass detection prompt as a scrutiny hint ("ad breaks have typically started near 12:30") and replace the global pre/mid/post-roll confidence boosts in validation with per-feed ones. A zone needs support in at least 60% of those learnable episodes and can span at most 10% of the episode (drifting break positions fail the gate instead of forming one giant zone); boosts stay capped at +0.10, cuts whose evidence is not position-independent (fingerprint, text pattern, language, manual, VAD gap) need at least 0.85 original confidence to feed the learning, and episodes whose length differs from the feed median by more than 2x skip the prior entirely. The verification pass and the retry-ad-detection endpoint are unaffected (both run on post-cut timelines where learned positions do not map).

## [2.8.8] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- Pass-2 ads keep the right original-time twin through validation. The validator sorts, merges and drops ads, but the pipeline paired its output with the unvalidated original list by position, so after a merge or reorder a surviving ad could carry another ad's original timestamps into the ad editor. Each original now rides through validation attached to its processed twin.
- A short real ad is no longer silently dropped. Cuts under 10 seconds were all discarded as likely hallucinations; a short cut now survives when a known fingerprint pattern matched it or detection confidence is at least 0.9. When a cut is dropped anyway, the ad editor now shows it as not cut instead of claiming it was removed.
- Transcript lines partially covered by cuts no longer leak ad words. A line under the 80 percent drop threshold was kept whole; its in-cut words are now trimmed using Whisper's word timestamps, with the old behavior kept for episodes without word timing.
- Overlapping spans in the combined cut list no longer double-shift transcript and chapter timestamps. adjust_timestamp merges spans into a union before subtracting, so a pass-2 ad touching a pass-1 cut cannot collapse segments to zero length.
- Pass-2 validation clamps against the real audio duration (ffprobe) instead of the last transcript segment's end, which Whisper routinely over- or under-runs.
- Audio cue (ding) timestamps land on the sound instead of up to a second after it. ebur128's momentary loudness window lags the true onset; the reported cue start is pulled back by a configurable onset lag (0.2s default).

## [2.8.7] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- LLM-only reprocess (#349) no longer transcribes at all. The first pass already reused the saved transcript, but the verification pass still re-transcribed the cut audio, so re-detecting ads still paid for one transcription. It now maps the saved transcript through the cuts to get the post-cut transcript instead of re-transcribing, so iterating on detection or LLM config is transcription-free. Audio-cue detection still runs on the real processed audio. The trade is that the verification pass can only re-examine what the saved transcript already captured; the other reprocess modes still re-transcribe.

## [2.8.6] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- A freshly published episode that 404s on download is now retried instead of failing permanently on the first attempt. Hosts like acast often advertise an episode in the feed a few minutes before the media URL is ready, so the first download attempt 404s. The error was classified as permanent, so the episode failed and served a 410 to subscribers until someone reprocessed it by hand. A download 404 is now treated as transient and flows into the existing retry ladder; a genuinely dead link still fails for good once it exhausts the retry limit.

## [2.8.5] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- The processed transcript no longer keeps a line whose audio was cut. A removed ad was only stripped from the transcript when a single cut covered more than 80 percent of a transcript line. A line that straddles two adjacent cuts (a first-pass cut and a verification re-cut that each take roughly half of it) slipped through and left the sponsor copy in the published transcript even though the audio for it was gone. Coverage is now measured against all of the cuts together, so a line that is almost entirely removed by the combined cuts is dropped.

### Changed

- Removed three internal merge marker fields that nothing read anymore (`validation_merged`, `merged_sponsor`, `merged_windows`); a single `merged_distinct_ads` marker replaced them in 2.8.4.

## [2.8.4] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Extended the 2.8.3 reviewer fix to the merge path that actually caused the Grainger survival. A back-to-back ad chain is collapsed into one cut by the window-deduplication step before validation ever sees it, and that step did not mark the result as a multi-ad span. So when the reviewer trimmed the merged block's end, it still severed the trailing ad. Re-verifying 2.8.3 on the Daily Tech News Show episode showed the cut was only saved by a second detection pass, not by the reviewer guard. Every merge that joins separate ads now sets one shared marker, including window and detection-stage merges and ads that sit exactly back-to-back, so the reviewer treats the whole span as expand-only. A single ad re-detected across an overlapping window is left tightenable as before.

## [2.8.3] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- The ad reviewer no longer drops a confirmed ad when several back-to-back ads were merged into one cut. When the validator joins adjacent ads across a short gap, or merges fragments of the same sponsor, the result is one span covering several independently detected ads. The reviewer refines that span's boundaries, and an inward pull could land mid-span and sever a trailing ad from the cut. On a sampled Daily Tech News Show episode this left a full Grainger read (about 26 seconds) in the audio after the reviewer trimmed the merged block's end. Merged spans are now expand-only in the reviewer: it can still grow a cut outward to catch a leading or trailing call to action, but it cannot shrink one below the union of the ads it already confirmed. Single detected ads are unaffected and still tighten normally.

## [2.8.2] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- Trailing call-to-action lines no longer survive at the end of a removed ad. Cut ends consistently landed a few seconds short, leaving the sponsor URL, a toll-free number, or a closing thank-you (3 to 19 seconds in sampled episodes) in the processed audio. The content-based end extension now runs once more after the ad reviewer, whose boundary verdicts could undo it. It also keeps walking past a connector line sandwiched between sponsor mentions instead of stopping at the first non-ad segment, recognizes toll-free phone numbers as ad content, and can extend up to 30 seconds instead of 15.
- The generated transcript, chapters, and the verification pass's timestamp mapping are now built from the cuts ffmpeg actually applied instead of the requested list. The two diverge whenever near-adjacent cuts merge, a sub-10-second cut is dropped as a likely false positive, or an end-of-episode cut runs to the end of the file. The divergence shifted every verification timestamp after the affected cut and made the published transcript disagree with the audio around it.
- The per-episode ads-removed count (episodes table, History page, completion log, webhook payload) now counts cuts that exist in the audio. A requested cut that merged into a neighbor still counts, but one filtered out as too short no longer inflates the number, and a verification-pass ad that the re-cut filtered away is no longer listed as removed in the ad editor.
- Cut timestamps are clamped to the audio bounds before cutting. Detection can produce an end past the real file duration (Whisper's last segment routinely overruns ffprobe), which previously fed ffmpeg an out-of-range trim; a fully out-of-range cut is now skipped with a log line. When every requested cut filters away, the audio is copied through instead of pointlessly re-encoded.
- The content-based boundary extension respects its 30-second window on both sides: a single long transcript segment straddling the boundary can no longer pull a cut past the window, and the post-reviewer tail sweep never extends a cut into the next detected ad.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- LLM-only reprocess (#349) now reuses the audio and transcript it already has instead of working against a fresh download. It reuses the retained original audio rather than re-downloading, so detection runs against the same recording it cuts. Dynamically inserted ads rotate between downloads, so the old behavior could detect one set of ads and cut another. It also reuses the saved Whisper segments, which carry word-level timestamps, instead of re-parsing the transcript text, which dropped that timing and measurably weakened first-pass detection.
- The audio cue detection experiment (#350) now reads its enable toggle and tuneables on each run rather than once at startup, so turning it on in Settings takes effect on the next reprocess without a container restart.
- The verification pass reuses the existing transcript when the first pass cut nothing, instead of re-transcribing the whole episode for an audio file that is identical to the original.
- An empty completion from the LLM provider is now retried and, if it persists, recorded as a failed detection window instead of being treated as "no ads found" (#358). A flaky or rate-limited endpoint can no longer pass an episode through looking clean. A genuine empty-ad-list response is unaffected.

### Changed

- Dropped the redundant "Experimental" label from the Audio Cue Detection settings card; it already sits under the Experiments section.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- LLM-only reprocess mode (#349). A new "Re-detect Ads" option reruns ad detection and re-cuts the audio using the transcript already saved for an episode, so it skips the transcription step that dominates processing time on local hardware. It is available per episode and in bulk; episodes without a saved transcript are skipped. The transcript is preserved rather than deleted, unlike the existing Reprocess and Full Analysis modes.
- Audio cue detection, an opt-in experiment (#350). Some shows play a short non-spoken ding or stinger just before an ad break that the transcript cannot capture. When enabled in Settings under Experiments, an extra ffmpeg pass band-passes the audio and flags brief loudness bursts in the cue's frequency band, then passes them to the ad detector as a timing hint. The cue never marks an ad on its own; the model must still find ad content in the transcript, so it only sharpens an ad's start time. The band, prominence threshold, and minimum confidence are tunable, and the Stats page shows how many cues were detected. Off by default.

### Fixed

- A podcast description containing the sequence `]]>` no longer corrupts the generated feed. That sequence closes a CDATA block early, which leaked the rest of the description as raw markup and broke the served XML for every subscriber of that podcast. Description text is now split across CDATA sections so the literal content round-trips intact.
- The single-feed "Force refresh" now actually forces a refresh. The handler cleared the ETag but dropped the force flag before calling the refresh, so the 30-second coalesce window could still suppress a refresh requested within that window.
- The pricing fetchers (OpenRouter, pricepertoken, LiteLLM) now cap the response body they read. A hostile or broken pricing host could previously return an unbounded body and exhaust worker memory.

### Changed

- Removed dead imports and unused locals flagged by static analysis, and declared the public re-export surface of the `ad_detector` package explicitly.

## [2.7.9] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- `MINUSPOD_PORT` sets the internal listen port, defaulting to 8000. It helps when you run with host networking or several instances on one host and need to move off 8000. `GUNICORN_BIND` still wins when set. The container healthcheck and the compose port mapping, expose, and healthcheck all follow the variable, so a custom port no longer leaves the container reporting unhealthy. (#352)

### Documentation

- Linked the community pattern set (`patterns/README.md`) directly from the README documentation table (#354).

## [2.7.8] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- LLM Tunables settings now save reliably (#351). The section had no Save button, and each field only committed when it lost focus, so on mobile an edit like raising the reviewer-pass token limit was usually discarded before it reached the server and reopening Settings showed the old default. Edits are now held and written in one request behind an explicit "Save LLM Tunables" button, matching the rest of the settings page.
- "Reset All" and the per-field Reset now return the per-stage LLM tunables to their defaults. These keys were skipped on reset, so a tunable kept its last value.

## [2.7.7] - 2026-06-07

### Changed

- Dependency updates rolled in from Dependabot. Python: anthropic 0.107.1, ctranslate2 4.8.0, beautifulsoup4 4.15.0, openai 2.41.0, scikit-learn 1.9.0. Frontend: react, react-dom, and react-is 19.2.7, react-router-dom 7.17.0, @tanstack/react-query 5.101.0, @types/react 19.2.17. CI: actions/checkout 6.0.3. (#338-#348)

## [2.7.6] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- The Sponsors table no longer shows a horizontal scrollbar on desktop. In the fixed-layout table the Actions column was too narrow for its Edit and Delete buttons, so the cell overflowed and the table scrolled sideways. The column widths are rebalanced so the row fits at desktop widths.

### Documentation

- Documented `OMP_NUM_THREADS` for local CPU transcription on hybrid Intel CPUs (issue #333). On 12th gen and newer Intel chips the default OpenMP thread pool spreads `faster-whisper` work across the slow E-cores and thrashes the cache; capping `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to the performance-core count, and optionally pinning the container to P-cores with `--cpuset-cpus` (Docker) or `CPUSetCPUs=` (Podman), removes the bottleneck. Added an `OMP_NUM_THREADS` row to `docs/environment-variables.md`, a commented example in `.env.example`, and an "Intel hybrid CPU tuning" section to `docs/installation.md`. No code change; the value is read by CTranslate2 because MinusPod leaves `cpu_threads` at its default.

## [2.7.5] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- The OpenRouter model dropdown now lists the `openrouter/free` and `openrouter/auto` router aliases (issue #331). Both are valid OpenRouter model IDs -- `openrouter/free` routes each request to one of OpenRouter's free models, `openrouter/auto` picks a model for the prompt -- but neither appears in OpenRouter's `/api/v1/models` response, so they never showed up in the dropdown and could not be selected. MinusPod now injects them when the provider is OpenRouter.

### Fixed

- A model the provider rejects as not-found now fails the episode with an actionable error instead of a generic "all windows failed" message. When every detection or verification window fails with a 404 or not-found, the error names the model and provider and notes that the provider's advertised model list can be incomplete, and the failure is marked non-retryable since a bad model ID will not recover on retry.

### Documentation

- Clarified model selection for issue #331: there is no `LLM_MODEL` environment variable (only `LLM_PROVIDER` selects the provider), and `OPENAI_MODEL` only seeds the model on first startup -- after that the stored value wins, so the model is changed in the Settings UI. Updated `docs/llm-providers.md`, `docs/environment-variables.md`, `.env.example`, and the Settings UI help text, and documented the `openrouter/free` and `openrouter/auto` aliases.

## [2.7.4] - 2026-06-05

### Fixed

- Stopped a `Migration failed for match_key backfill: UNIQUE constraint failed: model_pricing.match_key` warning that logged on every startup. The pricing migration backfills `match_key` for older rows, but when a row's normalized key already belonged to another row (for example a live-fetched variant of the same model), the per-row `UPDATE` hit the existing UNIQUE index and aborted the whole migration before its dedup step could run, so the row stayed unkeyed and the warning came back on the next boot. The backfill now skips a row whose key another row already owns -- that row is a redundant duplicate the cost lookup never uses -- and the dedup step only touches real keyed collisions, never the NULL rows. No pricing data is removed.

### Documentation

- Documented the sponsor-name normalization regex format in `docs/web-interface.md`: the `terms`/`canonical` fields, the case-insensitive `re.sub`, the lowercasing and whitespace-collapse steps, anchoring, and the convention where an uppercase-containing replacement also acts as a transcript display correction. Expanded the same page's Sponsors coverage with the delete-unlinks-patterns behavior, and noted the container capability hardening (`cap_drop: ALL` plus the minimal `cap_add` set) in `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Filled OpenAPI gaps from the 2.6.0-2.7.4 changes: `PUT /sponsors/{id}` now documents `tags`, `is_active`, and `common_ctas`; the normalization create/update endpoints document the `terms`/`canonical` fields (the legacy `pattern`/`replacement` names are still accepted on write).

## [2.7.3] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- `GUNICORN_BIND` now accepts a comma-separated list of addresses, so gunicorn can listen on more than one socket. This is mainly for rootless Podman, where you may want IPv4, IPv6, or both. For dual-stack, set `GUNICORN_BIND=[::]:8000` -- a single IPv6 wildcard also accepts IPv4 when the kernel keeps `bindv6only=0` (the Linux default). The default is unchanged (`0.0.0.0:8000`, IPv4), so existing Docker deployments behave as before. One caveat: don't list both `0.0.0.0:8000` and `[::]:8000` on a `bindv6only=0` kernel -- the IPv6 wildcard already claims the IPv4 port, so the second bind hits `EADDRINUSE` and gunicorn exits.

## [2.7.2] - 2026-06-04

### Fixed

- **Settings reset to defaults when you reopen the page (issue #323, reopened).** Navigating away from Settings and back within the React Query cache window made every field show its hardcoded placeholder again -- LLM provider back to Anthropic, no key, models blank -- even though the values were still saved in the database. The 2.6.0 fix seeded the hydration snapshot from the loaded settings, so on a remount with cached data the form never re-hydrated and fell through to the component's hardcoded `useState` initializers. The snapshot now starts empty so the form always re-hydrates from the loaded settings (the unsaved-edit guard is unchanged), and the page renders a loader until settings load so the placeholders are never shown. The earlier "fixed in 2.6.0" call was wrong because it was tested via a full page reload (always a cold load); the bug only appears on in-app navigation. Confirmed reproduced and fixed with the navigate-away-and-back flow.
- **No more hardcoded provider/model defaults in the Settings form.** The form's field defaults (provider, base URL, models, whisper backend/language/compute, audio bitrate, min-cut confidence, etc.) now come from the backend `GET /settings` `defaults` block -- the single source of truth -- instead of literals duplicated in the frontend. The hydration and change-detection paths share that source so the "Save Changes" button no longer risks getting stuck. On the backend, the OpenAI-compatible base URL default is now the `DEFAULT_OPENAI_BASE_URL` config constant (used by `get_effective_base_url`, the `LLMClient` fallback, and the defaults block), and the provider default in the defaults block resolves through the `ENV_BACKED_SETTINGS` registry, so each default is defined once. No default values changed.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- Sponsors page, Normalizations tab: the Pattern and Replacement columns were blank. The frontend read `pattern`/`replacement`, but the API returns those fields as `terms`/`canonical` (its v2 shape), so the values never rendered. The page now uses `terms`/`canonical`, matching the API. The OpenAPI `Normalization` schema is corrected to document `terms`/`canonical` (the legacy `pattern`/`replacement` names are still accepted on write).
- Sponsors page, Normalizations tab on mobile: the table had no narrow-screen layout, so columns collapsed and the headers and action buttons overlapped. It now uses the same card layout as the sponsors list on small screens.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added

- Sponsors management page (issue #304). A new top-level Sponsors page surfaces the sponsor list that until now could only be managed through the API, so the auto-created and typo'd sponsors that accumulate during pattern learning can finally be cleaned up. Each row shows the number of ad patterns linked to the sponsor, its created date, and when a linked pattern last matched. You can add, edit (name, aliases, category, tags, active), and delete sponsors, filter by tag, search, and reveal inactive ones. A second tab manages name normalizations (regex find/replace). Deleting a sponsor is a real delete, not a deactivation; any ad patterns linked to it are unlinked (their sponsor link is cleared) rather than removed, so no pattern data is lost. The delete dialog shows how many patterns will be unlinked.

### Changed

- `DELETE /api/v1/sponsors/{id}` now permanently removes the sponsor instead of marking it inactive, and returns `unlinkedPatterns` (the count of patterns whose sponsor link was cleared). `GET /api/v1/sponsors` and `GET /api/v1/sponsors/{id}` now include `pattern_count` and `last_matched_at`. The OpenAPI `Sponsor` schema gains `tags`, `pattern_count`, and `last_matched_at`, and drops the `updated_at` field it documented but never returned.

### Fixed

- History page: the "filter by podcast" dropdown is now sorted alphabetically by title instead of arriving in feed order.

## [2.6.2] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- Claude Opus 4.8 usage was cost-accounted at roughly 3x. The live pricing table (scraped from the provider's pricing page) did not list Opus 4.8 yet, so the lookup fell through to a prefix match and picked up Opus 4.0 rates ($15/$75 per million tokens) instead of the correct $5/$25. The built-in default pricing now includes Opus 4.7 and 4.8, and defaults are backfilled after every successful live fetch (Anthropic only), so a newly released Claude model is priced correctly until the upstream source catches up. A one-time migration recomputes any Opus 4.8 cost already recorded in the token-usage stats; no usage rows are removed.

## [2.6.1] - 2026-06-02

### Fixed

- Part of a Capital One ad could survive the cut. Two faults combined: the timestamp-correction step treated "one" (split out of the sponsor name "Capital One") as a brand keyword and moved the real detection onto unrelated show talk, and the reviewer's request to pull the cut start earlier was dropped because it came back under `corrected_start`/`corrected_end` keys the parser never read. A multi-word sponsor is now kept as a single phrase instead of being split into its generic words, and the reviewer honors the corrected-boundary keys when start/end are absent (the render prompt no longer asks for keys it ignores).

## [2.6.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- LLM benchmark: `benchmark run --snapshot <file>` and `benchmark report --snapshot <file>` pin the system prompt to a frozen file instead of the live `get_static_system_prompt()`. This decouples the stored corpus from the production `SEED_SPONSORS` list -- editing the sponsor list (or the prompt prose) no longer changes the prompt hashes and forces a full re-run. With no flag the live prompt is used as before. `benchmark dump-prompt <file>` writes the current live prompt to a file to seed a snapshot. The report's Run Metadata section records which prompt produced the run (`live` or `snapshot:<name>`) with a sha256 prefix.

### Changed

- LLM benchmark report: the TL;DR rankings (Best Accuracy, Best Value, Best Free-Tier) now lead with F0.5 instead of F1. MinusPod cuts the segments it flags, so a false positive (cutting real content) is worse than a false negative (leaving an ad in); F0.5 weights precision 2x recall to match. Best Accuracy and Best Free-Tier add a 95% confidence interval per model and group models into tiers by a paired one-sided t-test against the tier leader, so the top cluster that trades wins across the 12-episode corpus reads as one tier rather than a false strict order. Raw F1, precision, and recall stay as columns. Models are flagged (not reordered) for low JSON compliance (`brittle JSON`, < 0.90) or a failed no-ad negative control.

### Security

- **Pattern import replace-mode is now atomic.** A failure partway through a `mode=replace` import could permanently wipe the entire `ad_patterns` table, because the delete/create DB helpers committed individually and defeated the route's rollback. The import now runs as a single transaction through non-committing primitives, so a mid-import failure leaves every existing pattern intact.
- **The hardened Docker compose stack now boots.** `cap_drop: ALL` removed the capabilities `setpriv` needs to drop root, so the container crash-looped before gunicorn started. A `cap_add` block now restores only `SETUID`/`SETGID`/`CHOWN`/`DAC_OVERRIDE`/`FOWNER` while keeping `cap_drop: ALL` and `no-new-privileges`. Mirrored to `docker-compose.cpu.yml`.
- **Feed fetches use the strict SSRF tier by default (behavior change).** Stored feed URLs are re-fetched on every refresh; they are now DNS-resolved and blocked from private/loopback/metadata targets, closing a refresh-time DNS-rebinding window. Operators who serve feeds from a private/LAN address can opt back in with `MINUSPOD_ALLOW_PRIVATE_FEED_HOSTS=true`.
- **The API fails closed before an app password is set (behavior change).** A not-yet-bootstrapped install no longer exposes the database backup, cleanup/reset, provider rotate/test, or feed delete/update routes; read-only browsing and first-run feed creation still work so setup can finish.
- **Outbound fetches enforce hard byte caps and strip provider keys across host redirects.** Feed conditional/gzip-retry reads and audio downloads now cap the streamed body, closing decompression-bomb and disk-fill paths; `validate_base_url` resolves and rejects cloud-metadata/link-local targets reached via a hostname; and a redirect to a different host drops `x-api-key`/`api-key`.
- **A corrupt or missing crypto salt fails closed.** It is no longer silently regenerated while encrypted secrets exist (which would orphan them permanently), and the backup-decrypt tool reads the salt read-only instead of constructing the full database.
- **Login lockout hardened.** The failure counter increments atomically rather than via a SELECT-then-write that undercounts under concurrency, and an IPv4-mapped IPv6 public address can no longer evade it.

### Fixed (audit remediation)

- Interrupted DB table rebuilds no longer brick startup: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` guards each `*_new` rebuild and the episodes rebuilds recreate their full lookup-index set.
- Ad-detection window creation can no longer hang the worker when the overlap is configured at or above the window size.
- TF-IDF content matching now respects scope/tag/language filtering instead of scoring against every loaded pattern.
- Volume analysis no longer stalls the pipeline for hours: the ebur128 ffmpeg call is time-capped and, with the other ffmpeg/ffprobe calls, routed through the shutdown-aware subprocess wrapper.
- Custom webhook templates no longer silently drop auth-failure / rate-limit alerts; a render error falls back to the default payload and still delivers.
- Cron accepts day-of-week 7 as Sunday and applies a step to a single-value base (`5/15` -> 5, 20, 35, 50).
- The LLM benchmark report deduplicates overlapping-window predictions before scoring, removing a systematic downward bias on F1/precision/recall.
- Settings form edits are no longer discarded by a background `['settings']` refetch.
- Reprocess and artwork saves keep the existing file until the replacement is durable; community-sync refuses to mass-delete on an empty/truncated manifest; `split_bundle` rejects intra-run filename collisions; feed slugs are validated; OPML import is capped; plus assorted hardening across SSRF, secrets, concurrency, and the community-pattern tools.

### Upgrade notes

- No-password installs: without `APP_PASSWORD`, sensitive routes (backup, cleanup, provider rotate/test, feed delete/update) now return 403 until a password is set.
- Private/LAN feed hosts: set `MINUSPOD_ALLOW_PRIVATE_FEED_HOSTS=true` if any feed source is on a private/LAN address, otherwise those feeds are rejected at fetch time.
- Reverse proxy: set `MINUSPOD_TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` to the number of proxies in front of MinusPod so login lockout and rate limiting see the real client IP (defaults to 0).

### Dependencies

- Folded in the open Dependabot bumps: pip (`anthropic` 0.102.0 -> 0.105.2, `huggingface-hub` 1.16.1 -> 1.17.0, `idna` 3.16 -> 3.17), npm (`@tanstack/react-query`, `wavesurfer.js`, `vite`, `typescript-eslint`, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`), and GitHub Actions (`docker/login-action`, `actions/download-artifact`, `actions/upload-artifact`).

### Changed

- **`validator_known_sponsors.csv` is now sorted by sponsor name.** The seed list the PR validator checks against was in insertion order, which made it hard to scan when reviewing a submission. Rows are now sorted case-insensitively by name. The set of sponsors is unchanged, so validation results are identical.
- **The two Ad Reviewer settings sections are now one, under Experiments.** The reviewer LLM config (enable, model, boundary shift, parallel reviews, prompts) and the pattern-update controls (the update-from-adjustments toggle and trim threshold) were separate Settings sections that shared the name "Ad Reviewer" and each had its own Save button. They now live in a single Ad Reviewer section and persist together through the page's Save button. The fields are grouped with dividers (reviewer behavior, pattern learning, prompts) to match the layout of the other settings sections, and the trim-threshold input now follows the same style as the section's other numeric fields. The pattern-update fields still write to `/settings/reviewer`; only the UI and save flow merged.

### Fixed

- **Ad Reviewer prompts no longer get stuck blank, and the "Reset Reviewer Prompts to Default" button works (issue #301).** `review_prompt` and `resurrect_prompt` were missing from the defaults map in `reset_setting` (`src/database/settings.py`), so resetting them was a silent no-op and a cleared-then-saved prompt stayed empty with no way back. Both keys are now in the map. The settings GET handler also falls back to the default when a stored prompt is empty or whitespace, so an already-stuck install heals on the next load, and `_apply_prompt_fields` reverts a blank prompt to its default on save instead of storing the empty value.
- **`src/tools/generate_manifest.py` no longer rewrites `published_at` on no-op runs.** `build_manifest` stamped the current UTC time on every invocation, so the regenerate-manifest workflow's `git diff --quiet` was never quiet and it committed a timestamp-only change even when no pattern content changed (surfaced on PR #299). `main()` now reuses the prior timestamp when re-rendering the manifest with it reproduces the on-disk `index.json` byte-for-byte (`reuse_published_at`) -- the same rendered-bytes comparison the workflow's `git diff` makes, so a true no-op stays byte-identical and the commit step is skipped, while any real content change still bumps the timestamp.

## [2.5.34] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Three new benchmark corpus episodes** verified into `benchmarks/llm/data/corpus/`: `ep-crime-junkie-8ce498f299d7`, `ep-daily-gist-chicago-70a82fe93a5c`, `ep-drink-champs-30c9a2d49f13`. Each ships with `metadata.toml`, `truth.txt` (timestamps realigned via `scripts/realign_truth.py` to match the word-level whisper output), `segments.json`, and `windows.json`. Corpus grows from 11 to 14 episodes (now 10 ad-bearing + 4 no-ad). A fourth candidate (`ep-politics-politics-politics-9d7642c84fc9`) was verified, swept, then dropped: its single labeled sponsor read (4 seconds) was too tight to score against window-aligned predictions, and the episode's actual self-promo ads were missing from truth -- the net effect was every model scoring F1 = 0 on that episode regardless of correctness.
- **Full sweep against all 44 cloud models** including the 10 added this PR plus two more user-added Google Gemini 3.x variants (`google/gemini-3.5-flash`, `google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite`). `calls.jsonl` carries ~38,000 rows; `episode_results.jsonl`, `report.md`, and all 14 SVG assets regenerated. The full per-call raw text artifacts (`results/raw/prompts/*.txt` and `results/raw/responses/*.txt`) are committed so the report is reproducible from raw data without rerunning.
- **Updated cloud-LLM model recommendations in `docs/llm-providers.md`** to reflect the new sweep. New rank-1: `qwen/qwen3.6-plus` (F1 0.693, $1.11/episode) edges out `qwen3.5-plus-02-15` (F1 0.679) by 0.014, inside the trial-stdev noise floor. New "fast + accurate" tier added: `qwen/qwen3.6-flash` (F1 0.660, p50 13.0s, $0.55/episode).
- **Benchmark tool gains 10 new cloud models** in `benchmarks/llm/benchmark.toml.example` (also added to the gitignored live `benchmark.toml`): `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-2507`, `qwen/qwen3.6-plus`, `qwen/qwen3.6-flash`, `qwen/qwen3-8b`, `qwen/qwen3-14b`, `qwen/qwen3.5-27b`, `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro`, `google/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`. These are the cloud counterparts of the local recommendations in `docs/llm-providers.md`; they will populate the leaderboard after the next `benchmark run`.
- **Benchmark report TL;DR tables now expose F1 stdev and JSON mode columns.** The F1 stdev column reads from the existing `ModelStats.mean_f1_stdev` (the mean across episodes of within-episode trial stdev) so rank gaps inside the noise floor are no longer easy to over-read. The JSON mode column classifies each model as `native`, `prompt-inject`, or `mixed` based on the `json_format_used` field that the runner has been writing to `calls.jsonl` for some time; a model is `native` or `prompt-inject` only when >=95% of calls used that mode, otherwise `mixed`. The per-model detail block also shows the JSON-mode primary, the native percent, and the call count.
- **`src/tools/scaffold_community_pattern.py`** -- CLI helper for hand-crafting community pattern JSON. Writes a schema-correct file to `patterns/community/<slug>-<short_uuid>.json` so the filename matches the sponsor by construction. Closes the manual-contributor footgun behind PR #292.
- **`src/tools/split_bundle.py`** -- maintainer helper that explodes a `minuspod-submission-*.json` bundle into per-pattern `<slug>-<short>.json` files in the same directory using the shared `slugify` helper. Refuses to overwrite existing files; removes the bundle on success unless `--keep-original` is passed.
- **Pattern Export dialog lets the contributor refine sponsor, aliases, and tags per pattern before download.** Each row in the Export dialog grows an `Edit` toggle when the destination is `community`; the inline panel shows the sponsor / aliases / tags fields plus a live filename preview that matches what the PR validator's filename check will expect. Overrides are per-export only; the local pattern row is not modified. Backend routes (`/patterns/preview-export`, `/patterns/submit-bundle`) gained an additive optional `overrides` body field shaped `{ <pattern_id>: { sponsor?, sponsor_aliases?, sponsor_tags? } }`; existing callers that send no overrides keep the prior behaviour. Closes the upstream cause of the filename mismatches #294 catches at PR time.

### Changed

- **`benchmarks/llm/src/benchmark/pricing.py:fetch_current` now unions LiteLLM with OpenRouter's `/api/v1/models` endpoint** (via the production `fetch_openrouter_pricing` helper). OpenRouter wins on key collisions when its entry carries a non-zero price; zero-price OR entries are skipped so they cannot clobber valid LiteLLM prices. The change closes a latency gap where benchmarked models with new OpenRouter slugs showed up at $0.00 cost until LiteLLM indexed them. The module docstring is updated to reflect the dual-source merge.
- **Metric Key in the benchmark report (`_render_how_to_read`) documents the new JSON mode column** alongside JSON compliance and F1 stdev, restoring the "every column has a definition" contract.
- **Community pattern validator now hard-rejects filename / sponsor / community_id mismatches** in per-pattern files. The PR #292 round surfaced two cases (`spotify-07df78ed.json` containing a Shopify pattern; `merck-ca6c0db7.json` with `sponsor: "badcholesterol.com"`) that today only revealed themselves on human review. The check uses the same `slugify` helper the exporter uses, so files produced by the in-app export pipeline pass by construction. Bundle / per-pattern filename shape mismatches downgrade to warnings.
- **Truncated intro/outro variants surface as validator warnings** -- variants ending in `com`, `slash`, `the`, `at`, `and`, `or`, `to`, `of`, `a`, `an`, `for`, `in`, `on`, or a single non-`a`/`i` letter are flagged. Recall-only variants that look cut mid-clause (e.g. PR #292's vanta outro `"Go to V-A-N-T-A dot com slash com"`) clutter the pattern without matching anything new.
- **Renamed `src/seed_data/sponsors_final.csv` to `src/seed_data/validator_known_sponsors.csv`** to match its actual job today. The file was originally the v2.4.0 one-shot DB seed for `known_sponsors`; that migration is now gated by `sponsor_seed_revision = '2.4.0'` and CSV edits no longer reach existing instances. The only ongoing consumer is the PR validator's multi-sponsor-contamination check (`find_foreign_sponsors`), so the file name now reflects that. Docstrings in `community_tags.sponsor_seed` and `_reseed_known_sponsors` were updated to call out the divergence and to clarify that new entries should be added only when a brand commonly appears as a foreign mention inside other sponsors' ad copy (the Keeps / Grubhub leakage case the check was built for). No behaviour change.

### Fixed

- **Dropped a duplicate `[run]` / `[corpus]` block** at the bottom of `benchmarks/llm/benchmark.toml.example` that would have made the file unparseable as TOML for anyone copying it as their starting point.
- **CI pip-audit step now ignores PYSEC-2024-277 (joblib 1.5.3) and PYSEC-2025-183 (pyjwt 2.12.1)** while upstream fixes are pending. Both packages are at the latest release on PyPI; the advisories landed in pip-audit's database between today's main-branch run and this PR. The ignore list is targeted to these two PYSEC IDs only -- any future vulnerability still trips the gate.

### Notes for maintainers

- The committed `calls.jsonl` rows were generated against a `SEED_SPONSORS` list that briefly excluded the `Zyn` entry (a local diff that was later reverted to match main). The system prompt for ad detection joins SEED_SPONSORS names, so the stored `prompt_hash` values do not match what current `src/utils/constants.py` would produce. A fresh `benchmark run` will therefore see zero completed rows and dispatch the full ~40k-call sweep from scratch. The committed report and per-call artifacts remain valid for review; they are just not bit-reproducible from the committed code without restoring the Zyn-removed state.

## [2.5.33] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- **Re-publish under a new tag so Portainer's webhook pulls a fresh image.** No code changes vs `2.5.32` -- the `ttlequals0/minuspod:2.5.32` push contained the `bulk_upsert` discovery-count fix, but the running stack restarted from its local image cache (the tag string was unchanged) and never picked up the new layers. Bumping the tag forces a registry pull on the next webhook fire. Future deploys against a same-tag rebuild should either set the stack's pull policy to always or follow this same pattern.

## [2.5.32] - 2026-05-27

### Changed

- **Dashboard refresh controls now match the podcast detail page.** Each podcast card's `Refresh` / `Force refresh` dropdown trigger uses the same `px-3 py-1.5 sm:px-4 sm:py-2` sizing and default chevron as the `Refresh Feed` dropdown on `FeedDetail`, so the two pages look identical. The sibling Delete button on each card was bumped to match the new height.
- **Dashboard `Refresh All` is now a dropdown with a `Force Refresh All` option** that mirrors the per-card pattern. The primary item issues a conditional GET per feed; the secondary item posts `{"force": true}` so every podcast's stored ETag / Last-Modified is bypassed and every feed is fully re-fetched.
- **`refreshAllFeeds(options?)` in the frontend API client** now accepts an optional `{ force?: boolean }` argument, mirroring `refreshFeed`. Existing call sites without an argument continue to issue a non-force refresh.
- **Mobile FeedCard footer compacted.** `CopyButton` hides its label on mobile and the Delete button collapses to a `Trash2` icon at `<sm` so the new larger Refresh dropdown trigger doesn't push the row off the card edge. The grid is now explicitly `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` so the single-column mobile layout doesn't expand cards to widest-child min-content width.

### Fixed

- **`POST /feeds/refresh` now actually forces a re-fetch when `force=true`.** The handler used to clear every podcast's stored ETag and then call `refresh_all_feeds()` with no force argument, so per-feed work hit `refresh_rss_feed`'s 30-second `_refresh_coalesce` gate and silently skipped feeds touched recently (e.g. by the 15-minute background tick). `refresh_all_feeds(force=False)` now accepts the flag and threads it through to `refresh_rss_feed(force=True)`, which bypasses both the coalesce window and the conditional GET. New unit tests in `tests/unit/test_refresh_all_feeds_force.py` cover the propagation in both directions and the coalesce bypass.
- **Force-refresh now clears stale ETag/Last-Modified when upstream drops the header.** Previously `refresh_rss_feed` only updated the DB ETag when the new response carried at least one of the two headers; on `force=True` with a 200 OK that omits both, the old DB value persisted and could cause the next scheduled conditional GET to send a stale validator and get a false 304. The guard now also fires whenever `force=True`, so a force refresh always brings the stored validators back into sync with the actual response (even if that means clearing them).
- **`bulk_upsert_discovered_episodes` now returns the real new-row count.** SQLite's `cursor.rowcount` reports `1` for both the INSERT and the UPDATE branch of an `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` (and even for a UPDATE that sets every column to its current value), so the counter was incrementing for every re-touched row -- harmless for the DB but the downstream `Discovered N new episode(s)` log over-reported by orders of magnitude on a force refresh (e.g. `2697 new` when zero rows were actually inserted). The function now snapshots the existing GUID set up front and only counts genuinely new GUIDs. Added regression test in `tests/unit/test_database.py::TestBulkUpsertDiscoveredEpisodes::test_bulk_upsert_returns_zero_when_all_episodes_already_exist`.
- **FeedCard dropdown panel no longer clipped by the card's `overflow-hidden`.** The card root previously needed `overflow-hidden` to clip the artwork's square corner to the card's rounded top-left; the same property silently clipped the Refresh dropdown panel hanging below the footer. The artwork wrapper now owns its own `overflow-hidden rounded-tl-lg`, the footer carries `rounded-b-lg`, and the card root is free to overflow so dropdowns can escape.
- **Dashboard toolbar `overflow-x-auto` no longer clips the Refresh All dropdown panel.** Segmented-control scrolling moved into an inner wrapper; the outer toolbar row is now plain flex so the dropdown can render below the trigger without being cut off.
- **`DropdownMenu` now closes on outside click and `Escape`.** Pre-existing bug across all call sites (FeedCard, FeedListItem, FeedDetail, Dashboard) -- the menu only closed on trigger or item click, so users who opened it and then clicked elsewhere were left with a stuck-open menu. A new effect listens for `mousedown` / `touchstart` outside the menu root and for the `Escape` keypress.

### Documentation

- **OpenAPI: `POST /feeds/refresh` now documents the `force` request body** (the backend already accepted it; the spec was silent). Schema mirrors `/feeds/{slug}/refresh` with `additionalProperties: false`.

### Removed

- **`Keeps` removed from `SEED_SPONSORS`** (constants.py, the docstring sponsor list in the LLM prompt, and `sponsors_final.csv`). The brand name collides with the common English verb "keeps" and was generating too many validation false-positives in community pattern submissions. Sponsor count drops from 255 to 254; two count assertions in `tests/unit/test_sponsor_seed_idempotent.py` and `tests/unit/test_community_tags_constants.py` updated accordingly. Existing DB rows are untouched (sponsor seeding is additive; user-managed sponsors persist).

## [2.5.31] - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- **v1/v2 backfill: removed unsafe `COALESCE(..., 0)` on `ads_removed` and `ads_removed_firstpass`.** The 2.5.30 hardening pass added COALESCE wrappers intending to make the predicate NULL-tolerant, but the result was the opposite: for legacy episode rows where `ads_removed IS NULL` (manual repair, partial restore, or pre-default-backfill schema state), the COALESCE coerced NULL to 0 and the predicate matched, causing the UPDATE to overwrite `history.ads_detected` with 0. SQL's three-valued logic already excludes NULL rows automatically (`NULL = X` evaluates to NULL, falsy in WHERE), so dropping the COALESCE restores the safer behavior. Added a code comment to both v1 and v2 SQL blocks explaining why raw columns are intentional.
- **`record_processing_history` post-commit `logger.info` no longer false-negatives the webhook.** The trailing `logger.info(...)` after `conn.commit()` in `src/database/stats.py:record_processing_history` is now wrapped in `try/except: pass`. The 2.5.30 webhook short-circuit treats any exception from `record_processing_history` as "row not written" and skips `EVENT_EPISODE_PROCESSED`. Without this wrap, a broken log handler raising after the commit would skip the webhook for an episode whose row was already in the DB.
- **Webhook now fires when `podcast_data` is None.** The 2.5.30 short-circuit treated "podcast row not found" identically to "INSERT raised", which dropped the webhook for episodes whose podcast row was deleted/renamed mid-pipeline. The webhook payload only needs slug + episode_id + counts, all of which are available regardless of the podcast row state. Now only an actual exception from `record_processing_history` suppresses the webhook.

### Changed

- **`tests/unit/test_history_ad_count.py`: dropped the `__defaults__` snapshot+restore atexit hook.** Other test files using the same pattern do not restore either, so per-file restoration was theater rather than safety. Kept the tempdir `shutil.rmtree` cleanup.
- **`src/database/schema/__init__.py`: removed the duplicate `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations`** inside `_run_env_backed_settings_migration`. The hoisted CREATE at the top of `_run_schema_migrations` covers it. Renumbered the step comments accordingly.
- **CHANGELOG: restored the 2.5.29 Loki-silence breadcrumb** that the 2.5.30 rewrite had softened.

## [2.5.30] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **v2 backfill of `processing_history.ads_detected` for episodes where the reviewer rejected some pass-1 ads.** The v1 backfill in 2.5.29 compared `history.ads_detected` against `episodes.ads_removed_firstpass`, but `firstpass` stores the pass-1 DETECTION count (pre-reviewer), not the post-reviewer cuts that the buggy 2.5.27 writer captured. v1 only matched episodes where the reviewer rejected zero ads, so cases like `macbreak-weekly-audio:2d9ccd57b93b` (firstpass detection=10, reviewer kept 6, verification=2, total cuts=8) stayed at the wrong value of 6. v2 (`_run_backfill_history_ads_detected_v2` in `src/database/schema/__init__.py`) derives the correct pass-1 cut count as `ads_removed - ads_removed_secondpass`, which equals the buggy writer's value regardless of how many ads the reviewer rejected or resurrected. New gate row `backfill_history_ads_detected_v2_postreviewer_cuts` so v2 runs once on the next boot for every deployer; v1's gate stays set and v1 does not re-run. v1-corrected rows are naturally excluded from v2 because their `ads_detected == ads_removed` and v2 requires `ads_detected == ads_removed - secondpass`, impossible when `secondpass > 0`.
- **Webhook now only fires when the history row is written.** `_record_history_and_event` previously had separate `try/except` blocks for `record_processing_history` vs `fire_event`, so a failed history INSERT (disk full, locked DB, missing podcast row) still fired `EVENT_EPISODE_PROCESSED` with an `ads_removed` total that no `/api/v1/history` row backed. External webhook consumers and the History page are now consistent: if the history row was not written, the webhook is skipped and the skip is logged.
- **Backfill hardening for v1 and v2.** Five defensive changes to `_run_backfill_history_ads_detected[_v2]` in `src/database/schema/__init__.py`: (a) `conn.rollback()` on outer-`except` so a v1 failure cannot leak uncommitted UPDATEs into v2's commit; (b) `INSERT OR IGNORE` on the gate-row INSERT so a concurrent gunicorn worker's race does not raise `UNIQUE constraint failed`; (c) `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schema_migrations` is hoisted to the top of `_run_schema_migrations` so the backfills no longer depend on `_run_env_backed_settings_migration` succeeding first; (d) `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (... ORDER BY processed_at DESC, h.id DESC)` adds a stable tie-break so two history rows written in the same second pick the actual latest by primary-key order; (e) `COALESCE(..., 0)` wraps `ads_removed`, `ads_removed_firstpass`, `ads_removed_secondpass` so legacy rows with NULL columns are treated as 0 instead of silently failing the predicate.
- **`_log_completion_summary` `verification_count` is now keyword-only.** Inserting `verification_count` into the positional signature in 2.5.28 created a footgun where a future positional caller using the older 7-arg form would shift a float `original_duration` into the `verification_count` slot. The `*,` separator forces all callers to pass it by name.
- **v1 log lines unified with v2 f-string format.** On the 2.5.29 deploy, v1's per-row `%`-format `logger.info(...)` calls never surfaced in Loki despite the data update committing correctly; other `database.schema` log lines from the same boot were ingested fine. Root cause is still unconfirmed (likely upstream of the logger: a Loki promtail filter or an early-boot stdout buffering issue, not the format style itself), but switching v1 to f-strings keeps the migration's log shape consistent across both helpers and avoids one variable while we investigate.

### Operator notes

- **Aggregate ad-count totals will step up after this release.** Endpoints and dashboards that SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX `processing_history.ads_detected` (`/api/v1/history/stats`, the dashboard stats query in `src/database/stats.py`) reflect the corrected totals after backfill, so historical numbers jump for any deployer who had pre-2.5.28 episodes with verification re-cuts. This is the intended correction, not a regression.
- **Orphan history rows are not backfilled.** Both migrations `INNER JOIN episodes`, so any history row whose episode row was already purged (feed dropped the episode, manual cleanup) stays at its undercounted value. The History page entry for such episodes will continue to show the pre-2.5.28 number.

### Added

- **`tests/unit/test_history_backfill_migration_v2.py`: 7 cases.** The macbreak-style row (firstpass != cuts because reviewer rejected) gets corrected. v1-already-corrected rows are not touched. Episodes with `secondpass=0` are untouched. Older reprocess rows are left alone while the latest row is corrected. The gate prevents v2 from running twice. Failed-status rows are untouched. The coexistence test verifies that a single boot of a deployer upgrading from `<=2.5.28` directly to 2.5.30 corrects both the easy-case rows (via v1) and the reviewer-rejected rows (via v2).

## [2.5.29] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **Backfilled `processing_history.ads_detected` for episodes affected by the pre-2.5.28 verification undercount.** A one-shot migration in `src/database/schema/__init__.py` (`_run_backfill_history_ads_detected`) repairs the LATEST `processing_history` row per `(podcast_id, episode_id)` where the bug pattern is unambiguous. Safe-update predicate: `status='completed'` AND the matching `episodes` row has `ads_removed_secondpass > 0` (verification re-cut happened) AND `history.ads_detected == episode.ads_removed_firstpass` (history captured pass-1 only, the bug signature) AND `history.ads_detected != episode.ads_removed` (skip rows already correct). For matching rows, `ads_detected` is updated to `episode.ads_removed` (the correct total stored by `_persist_episode_state`). Each update logs the before/after values at INFO. Gated by `schema_migrations` row `backfill_history_ads_detected_for_verification`, so the migration runs once per database.
- **Older reprocess rows are deliberately left alone.** The `episodes` table retains only the latest processing state, so for episodes that were reprocessed before 2.5.28, prior history rows cannot be safely corrected without inventing data. The migration only touches the LATEST history row per episode. Aggregate totals in `/api/v1/history/stats` will rise after this migration runs but will remain slightly low for any deployer who had reprocessed episodes with verification cuts before the fix.

### Added

- **`tests/unit/test_history_backfill_migration.py`: 6 cases.** Latest row gets corrected when bug signature matches; already-correct rows are untouched; rows for episodes with `secondpass=0` are untouched; older reprocess rows survive while the latest row is corrected; the gate prevents the migration from running twice; failed-status rows (which legitimately store `ads_detected=0`) are untouched.

## [2.5.28] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **History page (and `/api/v1/history`) ad count undercounted by the verification re-cut.** `src/main_app/processing.py:_record_history_and_event` recorded `ads_detected=len(ads_to_remove)` and ignored the `verification_count` it received as a parameter; `_persist_episode_state` already stored the total (`len(ads_to_remove) + verification_count`) on the episodes table, so the two write paths disagreed. Settings -> History showed pass-1-after-reviewer counts; episodes where pass 1 removed nothing but verification re-cut found ads showed `0` next to real cuts. The webhook payload (`EVENT_EPISODE_PROCESSED`) inherits the bug since `webhook_service.py:420` reads `ads_removed` from `history.ads_detected`. Changed the `ads_detected` argument in `_record_history_and_event` to `len(ads_to_remove) + verification_count`.
- **`Complete: N ads removed` log line had the same undercount.** `_log_completion_summary` formatted `len(ads_to_remove)` into the completion log without receiving `verification_count`, so it reported pass-1 cuts only. Episodes where pass 1 removed nothing but verification re-cut found 1 logged `Complete: 0 ads removed` next to a real 1-minute drop in duration. Plumbed `verification_count` into the function; the log now reports `len(ads_to_remove) + verification_count`.

### Added

- **`tests/unit/test_history_ad_count.py`: regression test pinning the history-ad-count contract.** Five cases: history records total (pass-1 + verification) and not pass-1 alone; the zero-verification path still records pass-1; the zero-pass-1-positive-verification path (the `glt1412515089:a40d43aec65b` scenario that prompted the audit) records the verification cuts; the completion log line includes verification in its total; the completion log reports `0 ads removed` when neither pass cut anything. Without these, the omission would have been invisible to CI for a third release in a row.

## [2.5.27] - 2026-05-26

### Fixed

- **`openapi.yaml`: duplicate keys in the `PUT /settings/ad-detection` request body.** The request-body schema redundantly defined `audioBitrate`, `skipFlacCompression`, `adDetectionParallelWindows`, and `adReviewerParallelAds` twice -- once with the GET-response shape (`{value, isDefault}` object) and once with the actual request shape (plain string / boolean / integer). YAML parsers silently keep the last occurrence; OpenAPI validators warn or fail. The misplaced object-shape entries were copied from the response-side schema; the API only accepts plain values (e.g. `{"audioBitrate": "192k"}`), and the `_apply_audio_fields` handler in `src/api/settings.py` reads `data['audioBitrate']` directly as a string. Removed the misplaced object-shape block from the PUT request body and kept the plain-type entries. The other two locations where these fields appear (the `Settings` response schema at line 4922 with object shape, and the `Settings.defaults` sub-object at line 5078 with plain shape) are intentional and unchanged -- they describe distinct response shapes, not the request body. Original duplicate-key bug was for `audioBitrate` only; the same broken pattern was extended to the three new fields when they were added in 2.5.23. The bug went undetected because PyYAML silently keeps the last occurrence on duplicate keys -- no parse error, no warning, no CI step validated the spec. External fork user `s1shed` flagged the original `audioBitrate` duplicate (PR #287).

### Added

- **`tests/unit/test_openapi_spec.py`: regression guards for `openapi.yaml`.** Five test cases close the gap that let the duplicate-key bug ship: (1) the spec parses with the standard SafeLoader; (2) a `StrictDuplicateKeyLoader` subclass rejects any duplicate key inside any mapping (this would have failed the 2.5.23 branch immediately); (3) a meta-test confirms the strict loader actually raises on a known-duplicate fixture; (4) top-level shape sanity (`openapi`, `info.version`, `paths`, `components` all present); (5) the `/settings/ad-detection` PUT request body uses plain primitive types (`string`, `boolean`, `integer`) for the four fields the bug touched, not the response-side `object` wrapper. Pure stdlib + PyYAML, no new dependencies.

## [2.5.26] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **"Parallel ad reviews" knob moved to the correct UI section.** 2.5.25 placed the input in `AdReviewerSection.tsx` (the small section that controls reviewer-feedback pattern auto-updates), but the user-visible "Ad Reviewer" controls live in `ExperimentsSection.tsx` (which holds the reviewer Enable toggle, model selector, max boundary shift, and prompts). The knob is now under the same "Ad Reviewer" section that already contains the reviewer execution settings, beneath "Max boundary shift". Backend exposes the same `adReviewerParallelAds` field on the main `/settings` endpoint alongside `adDetectionParallelWindows`; the alternate `/settings/reviewer` exposure remains in place for API consumers that prefer the dedicated endpoint.

## [2.5.25] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Parallel reviewer passes via a separate `AD_REVIEWER_PARALLEL_ADS` knob.** 2.5.23 parallelized ad detection and verification windows; the Ad Reviewer was left sequential because it iterates one ad at a time rather than one window at a time. `AdReviewer._review_inner` now runs the accepted and resurrection pools through a shared `_run_review_batch` helper that uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` with bounded concurrency, position-indexed merge to keep verdicts in input order, and an early-exit single-item path that skips the executor entirely. Default 4 concurrent reviews; validated [1, 32]. Exposed in the Settings page under the existing "Ad Reviewer" section as a new "Parallel ad reviews" numeric input, and on the API via `GET/PUT /settings/reviewer` as `parallelAds` / `parallelAdsDefault`. Setting to 1 preserves the original sequential behavior. Registered in `ENV_BACKED_SETTINGS` so the same data-preserving migration story from 2.5.23 applies (UI customizations survive env changes).

## [2.5.24] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **"Skip FLAC compression" toggle is now visible in Settings regardless of the active Whisper backend.** 2.5.23 placed the control inside the `whisperBackend === WHISPER_BACKENDS.OPENAI_API` conditional block, which made the toggle invisible on Local-Whisper deployments and prevented operators from configuring the preference before switching backends. Moved the toggle out of the conditional so it always renders under the Transcription section. The help text now states explicitly that the setting only takes effect when the Whisper backend is set to API; on Local Whisper the toggle stores the preference for later use but is a no-op because no audio is uploaded to begin with.

## [2.5.23] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **"Skip FLAC compression" toggle for the Whisper API path.** A new boolean setting `skipFlacCompression` (DB key `skip_flac_compression`, env `SKIP_FLAC_COMPRESSION`, default false) lets operators running self-hosted Whisper servers that accept WAV directly skip the intermediate FFmpeg FLAC encode in `Transcriber._transcribe_via_api`. Default-off preserves the existing FLAC compression so public OpenAI / OpenRouter endpoints stay under their upload size limits. Exposed in Settings under Transcription -> Whisper API and via `/settings` GET / `/settings/ad-detection` PUT. Reset returns to false. First implemented in the leboff/MinusPod fork; attribution added retroactively.
- **Parallel ad-detection windows.** Replaces the sequential per-window LLM loop in `AdDetector.detect_ads()` and `run_verification_detection()` with a `ThreadPoolExecutor` so independent transcript windows run concurrently through the LLM. New `adDetectionParallelWindows` setting (DB key `ad_detection_parallel_windows`, env `AD_DETECTION_PARALLEL_WINDOWS`, default 4, validated range [1, 32]). 1 preserves the original sequential behavior; higher values cut wall-clock detection time at the cost of concurrent load on the LLM provider. Exposed in the Settings page under LLM Tunables in a new "Detection Concurrency" block and via `/settings` GET / `/settings/ad-detection` PUT. Window-position-indexed merge keeps the resulting ads in transcript order even when futures complete out of order. A per-call progress lock prevents two completed workers from racing on the progress callback. First implemented in the leboff/MinusPod fork; attribution added retroactively.

### Changed

- **`ENV_BACKED_SETTINGS` registry with data-preserving migration.** Central registry in `src/config.py` describes every setting whose default comes from an environment variable: `(db_key, env_var, fallback, validator)`. First four entries: `llm_provider`, `audio_bitrate`, `skip_flac_compression`, `ad_detection_parallel_windows`. On every boot `_run_env_backed_settings_migration` in `src/database/schema/__init__.py` (a) ensures a `schema_migrations` table exists, (b) logs an audit line per registered key, (c) runs a one-shot corrective gate that flips `is_default` to 0 for any row where `is_default=1` but value diverges from env, **preserving the stored value** -- no deployer's DB loses data, (d) re-syncs `is_default=1` rows to the current env on every subsequent boot. Stops the recurrence pattern that caused issue #266 (env-backed settings ignored after first DB init) without overwriting customizations made via the UI. First implemented in the leboff/MinusPod fork; attribution added retroactively.
- **Per-episode token accumulator is now lock-protected instead of thread-local.** `_episode_accumulator` in `src/llm_client.py` was a `threading.local()` so different gunicorn threads couldn't corrupt each other. With ad-detection windows now running on a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, worker threads need to contribute to the same totals as the main thread. The accumulator is now a single `_EpisodeAccumulator` object guarded by `threading.Lock`. Single-episode isolation is enforced upstream by the fcntl flock on `.processing_queue.lock`, so the global accumulator is correct in practice. The existing `start_episode_token_tracking()` / `get_episode_token_totals()` public API is unchanged.

## [2.5.22] - 2026-05-25

### Fixed

- **Third-party HTTP/LLM SDK DEBUG output no longer bleeds into Loki when `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`.** Production runs at DEBUG so the application's own loggers (`podcast.refresh`, `podcast.patterns`, `pricing_fetcher`, `storage`, etc.) can be inspected, but the same setting was letting `openai._base_client`, `httpcore.http11`, and `httpx` emit full request/response dumps -- request headers, idempotency keys, response bodies -- on every LLM call. `setup_logging` in `src/main_app/__init__.py` now pins `openai`, `httpx`, `httpcore`, `anthropic`, `asyncio`, `charset_normalizer`, and `requests` to WARNING regardless of root level. The application's `podcast.llm_io` logger is unaffected so prompt/response capture still works on demand. Loki triage post-2.5.21 surfaced roughly 35 of these DEBUG lines per ad-detection run, plus continuous chatter from RSS refresh and pricing-fetcher; that volume now stays out of the log stream.

## [2.5.21] - 2026-05-24

### Changed

- **Rolled up 14 open Dependabot updates** onto the 2.5.20 transport-bar fix. Pip: `idna` 3.15 -> 3.16 (CVE-2026-45409 floor bump), `huggingface-hub` 1.15.0 -> 1.16.1, `ctranslate2` 4.7.1 -> 4.7.2, `openai` 2.37.0 -> 2.38.0, `pyjwt` 2.12.1 -> 2.13.0. npm (frontend dev/runtime): `@tailwindcss/vite` 4.2.4 -> 4.3.0, `typescript-eslint` 8.59.3 -> 8.59.4, `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` 8.59.3 -> 8.59.4, `@types/react` 19.2.14 -> 19.2.15, `react-router-dom` 7.15.0 -> 7.15.1. Docker base: `nvidia/cuda` 12.9.1-runtime-ubuntu24.04 -> 12.9.2-runtime-ubuntu24.04 (GPU image only; `Dockerfile.cpu` stays on `ubuntu:24.04` per the mirror checklist). GitHub Actions (SHA-pinned, SHAs copied from each Dependabot PR rather than typed): `actions/setup-python` v5.6.0 -> v6.2.0 (regenerate-manifest workflow), `docker/setup-buildx-action` v4.0.0 -> v4.1.0 and `docker/build-push-action` v7.1.0 -> v7.2.0 (cpu-image workflow, both setup-buildx call sites). Closes #272, #273, #274, #275, #276, #277, #278, #279, #280, #281, #282, #283, #284, #285.

## [2.5.20] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Ad Review transport bar keeps the speed selector inline with the playback buttons on narrow viewports** instead of wrapping it to a new row inside the box (2.5.19's approach, which the design rejected). The buttons cluster + selector is compacted in place: per-button padding `p-2` -> `p-1.5`, inner gap `gap-1` -> `gap-0.5`, the decorative `border-l` divider between Stop and the selector is dropped, and the selector itself shrinks from `h-8 pl-2 pr-5` to `h-7 pl-1.5 pr-4` with the chevron pulled in from `right-1.5` to `right-1`. Saves roughly 50 px of inner-row width, enough that all 7 controls fit on a single row inside the bordered transport bar at typical mobile widths. Outer container's `flex-wrap` is kept so the time readout still drops below the controls if space is too tight; the readout was never the overflow culprit.

## [2.5.19] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **Ad Review transport bar no longer overflows on narrow viewports.** The playback-rate `<select>` lives in the same inner flex container as the play/seek buttons inside the bordered transport bar in `AdReviewModal`. The outer container already had `flex-wrap`, so the right-side time readout dropped to a new row on narrow widths, but the inner buttons div lacked `flex-wrap`, so the speed selector was pushed past the container's right border and rendered visually outside the box. Added `flex-wrap` to the inner div so the selector now wraps onto a new row inside the bordered control rather than escaping it.

## [2.5.18] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **Pull-to-refresh in the PWA.** Native browser pull-to-refresh is disabled in installed (`display: standalone`) PWAs, so users on the home-screen icon had no way to refresh short of force-quitting the app. Adds whole-app pull-to-refresh via `pulltorefreshjs` (~5 KB gzipped). Triggers `window.location.reload()` only when the user has pulled at least 80 px past the top AND held there for 300 ms before releasing -- a fast flick or short pull snaps back with no action. Implementation is in `frontend/src/App.tsx`: `PullToRefresh.init` mounted from a `useEffect`, plus a side-channel `touchmove` listener that runs the 300 ms dwell timer (the library exposes no per-frame pull callback). The library's standard `.ptr--ptr` indicator colour-shifts to the primary theme token while the dwell timer is running so the user gets a "keep holding" cue. Suppressed when `window.scrollY != 0`, on the Login route, while an `input`/`textarea`/`select` has focus, and against re-entrant touchstart so a second finger does not overwrite the pull origin. `overscroll-behavior-y: contain` added to `html` to block the browser's own pull-to-refresh / rubber-band so the two handlers do not fight.

## [2.5.17] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Audio bitrate setting now actually saves.** The Storage section's Audio Bitrate selector has been wired in the frontend since 2.4.x and `main_app/processing.py` reads `audio_bitrate` from the DB at FFmpeg-encode time, but `src/api/settings.py` neither returned `audioBitrate` from `GET /settings` nor handled it on `PUT /settings/ad-detection`. Changing the value in the UI looked successful but never reached the DB, so every output kept re-encoding at the seeded `128k` default. Four pieces: (1) `config.py` exports `ALLOWED_AUDIO_BITRATES = ('64k','96k','128k','192k','256k')` and `DEFAULT_AUDIO_BITRATE = '128k'` as the single source of truth shared with `AudioSection.tsx`; (2) `GET /settings` now exposes `audioBitrate` as a standard `{value, isDefault}` entry and surfaces the default in the response's `defaults` block; (3) the PUT chain gains an `_apply_audio_fields` phase that validates against the allowed set (returns 400 on anything else) and persists; (4) `POST /settings/ad-detection/reset` also resets `audio_bitrate`, with `database.settings.reset_setting` carrying the matching default.
- **Cancel button now works for queued episodes (closes the cancel-while-queued silent 400).** `POST /feeds/{slug}/episodes/{id}/cancel` only accepted `status == 'processing'`, so clicking Cancel on an episode that was queued (status `pending`, sitting in the display queue and `auto_process_queue` waiting for the lock) returned HTTP 400 with the misleading message "Episode is not processing" and the row stayed queued. Two pieces: `StatusService.remove_queued_episode(slug, episode_id) -> bool` drops the entry from the display queue under the existing `_status_lock` and emits a subscriber notification; the cancel endpoint branches on status, calling `remove_queued_episode` + `db.close_queue_rows_for_episode` (helper at `database/queue.py:153`) and returning 200 with "Episode removed from queue" when either succeeds. 400 is returned only when the episode is neither processing nor queued. The live-cancel path also calls both helpers as belt-and-suspenders, so a follow-up enqueue starts from a clean slate after cancelling a stuck job.
- **Whisper API now falls back to segment-only timestamps when the server rejects word timestamps.** `Transcriber._transcribe_via_api` hardcoded `'timestamp_granularities[]': ['segment', 'word']` and treated any non-200 response as a hard failure. OpenAI-compatible servers that do not support word-level timestamps (OpenVINO Model Server returns the rejection as a MediaPipe-style 5xx; some `faster-whisper-server` builds return 400) silently failed the entire transcription instead of degrading. New module-level helper `_whisper_api_rejects_word_timestamps(response)` inspects the response body for any of `'word timestamp'`, `'timestamps not supported'`, or `'timestamp_granularities'` (case-insensitive, exception-safe). The retry loop is wrapped in an outer iteration over `(['segment','word'], ['segment'])`: on a first-attempt non-200 that matches the rejection marker, a `WARN`-level log explains why downstream cuts will be coarser ("Whisper API does not support word timestamps; retrying with segment-only timestamps") and the request is reissued with segment-only granularity. The existing 5xx backoff, `SSRFError` handling, and `OPERATOR_CONFIGURED` URL trust are preserved.

## [2.5.16] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **Provider-change pruning no longer wipes saved model selections when the new catalog probe comes back empty (closes #266).** `_apply_provider_fields` calls `client.list_models()` on the new provider and resets any saved `claude_model` / `verification_model` / `chapters_model` whose ID is not in the returned list. The OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs catch HTTP errors internally and return an empty list rather than raising, so a bad key, unreachable host, or rate-limited probe all looked the same as "no models advertised", and the pruner then reset every previously saved selection to the provider default. Anyone who hit Save in the LLM Provider section while their key was wrong saw their ad-detection model silently revert to `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`. The pruner now runs only when `advertised` is non-empty. When the probe raises or returns empty, the saved selections survive and a warning logs that the catalog was unavailable. New cases in `tests/unit/test_settings_validation.py::TestProviderChangeModelPruning` pin this behaviour (empty list, raised exception, populated list still prunes mismatched entries).
- **`AIModelsSection` now surfaces the saved model ID when it is missing from the current provider's catalog.** If the saved value did not appear in the live `/v1/models` response (stored tag belongs to a different provider, model renamed upstream, probe failed), the `<select>` rendered blank because no `<option>` matched, and operators read that as "the setting was reset". Each model dropdown now renders a leading `(current, not in catalog)` option carrying the saved value, so the persisted setting stays visible.

## [2.5.15] - 2026-05-21

### Fixed

- **Storage & Retention: Save button moved to bottom of section.** In 2.5.14 the Save Retention Settings button sat between the processed-retention block and the original-retention block, which read as "Save belongs to the top only". The button persists both retention values; placing it after the original retention input matches what it actually does.

## [2.5.14] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Separate retention period for retained original audio (closes #264).** Pre-2.5.14 the pre-cut original copy of each episode shared one retention window with the processed file: when `retention_days` elapsed, both got unlinked together in `cleanup_episode_files()`. Operators who wanted to keep the processed file for the full 30 days but drop the original sooner had no way to express that. Four pieces:
  - `GET/PUT /api/v1/settings/retention` now exposes `originalRetentionDays` alongside `retentionDays`. When unset, the API returns the same value as `retentionDays`, so existing installs see no behaviour change. Server clamps `originalRetentionDays <= retentionDays` on save (an original outliving its processed peer would be orphaned the moment the next cleanup pass resets the episode to Discovered).
  - `MaintenanceMixin.cleanup_old_episodes` runs a new pre-pass that calls `storage.delete_original_only(slug, episode_id)` for episodes whose `processed_at` is past `original_retention_days` but still inside `retention_days`. Episode stays `processed`; only the pre-cut original is freed. The pre-pass is a no-op when `keep_original_audio = false` (no originals to drop), when `original_retention_days` is unset, or when `original_retention_days >= retention_days` (the existing full-cleanup pass already covers it).
  - Settings UI gets a sibling number input under the existing "Keep original audio" toggle. Disabled when either retention is off or keep-original is off. Browser `max` attribute caps spinner; `onBlur` clamps a hand-typed out-of-range value; an inline destructive warning shows while a user mid-edits an invalid value, then disappears once it clamps. The existing "Save Retention Settings" button persists both values in one POST.
  - `storage.delete_original_only(slug, episode_id, extension='.mp3')` returns `(deleted: bool, bytes_freed: int)`.

## [2.5.13] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **Verification-pass auto-pattern-creation now matches the filter discipline of the first-pass learner.** Pre-2.5.13, `pattern_service.record_verification_misses` trusted every "missed ad" the verification LLM reported and called `text_pattern_matcher.create_pattern_from_ad` with no confidence floor, no `was_cut` check, and only a presence-only sponsor-in-intro test downstream. The first-pass learner at `ad_detector._ad_passes_learning_filters` already enforced `confidence >= 0.85` (`>= 0.92` for ads longer than 90 s), `was_cut == True`, and `detection_stage == 'claude'`. That asymmetry produced Pattern #354 (drink-champs, sponsor=Modelo): the verification LLM read host conversation about "how you get the big, Modelo?" as a missed Modelo ad and the auto-creator wrote 870 chars of unrelated dialogue into a podcast-scoped pattern. The function has carried the presence-only check since commit `f07ddf3` on 2025-12-17. Five filters added at the verification-miss entry point: (1) `confidence >= 0.85` floor, `>= 0.92` for ads with `duration > 90 s`; (2) reject when `reason` starts with a `SPONSOR_REASONING_PREFIXES` entry or contains a `SPONSOR_REASONING_SUBSTRINGS` entry (catches the case where the LLM put its rationale in the `reason` field); (3) require the sponsor brand (with aliases and whitespace-stripped variants via `count_brand_occurrences`) to appear at least twice in the actual transcript window between `start` and `end`. The existing "boost the matching pattern's `confirmation_count`" path also goes through the same filters now; this matters because the boost path inflates `confirmation_count` and was making it look like rare-brand patterns had "matched real ads" when they had only been re-flagged by the same kind of host-name-drop the original pattern came from.
- **`text_pattern_matcher.create_pattern_from_ad` now requires `duration >= 15 s`** in addition to the existing `<= 120 s` upper bound. Pattern #356 (Patreon, 8 s, first-pass detection) was the canonical floor false-positive: a real sponsor read does not fit in eight seconds. The guard keeps the same shape as the original duration check, with a matching warning log.
- **Sponsor occurrence guard in `create_pattern_from_ad` is now alias-aware.** The 2.5.13a draft used a raw substring count on the canonical sponsor string. That undercounted patterns where the brand lives only inside a compound (e.g. "DeleteMe" inside `joindeleteme.com`) and would have wrongly rejected the existing Pattern #350. The new check uses `community_export.count_brand_occurrences`, which counts case-insensitive substring matches across `known_sponsors.name`, every alias, and whitespace-stripped variants of both. Real ads where the canonical brand is referenced only via a URL or alias now pass; one-mention name-drops still fail. Falls back to `{name: sponsor, aliases: '[]'}` when `get_known_sponsor_by_name` returns nothing, so installs that haven't yet seeded their sponsor catalog still get the guard.
- **One-shot `_cleanup_low_mention_patterns` migration retires structurally false-positive rows.** Rewritten from the 2.5.13a draft (which had a single criterion of "fewer than 2 sponsor occurrences" and would have disabled eight patterns with `confirmation_count > 0` that have matched real ads). New criteria, all conservative, must each be satisfied independently to disable a row:
  - **low-mention auto-created never-matched**: brand variants appear <2 times in `text_template` AND `created_by = 'auto'` AND `confirmation_count = 0` AND `false_positive_count = 0`;
  - **sponsor field is an LLM rationale**: `sponsor` starts with a `SPONSOR_REASONING_PREFIXES` entry or contains a `SPONSOR_REASONING_SUBSTRINGS` entry (catches Pattern #202 where the full Walden University reasoning sentence got stored as the sponsor name);
  - **sponsor field has an LLM-suffix tell**: ends with `' brand'`, `' pre-roll'`, `' sponsor ad'`, `' sponsor ad with url'`, or `' advertisement'` (catches Pattern #227 `Grainger brand`);
  - **sponsor is non-canonical AND no template variant matches**: sponsor stripped of whitespace is not in `known_sponsors` AND no brand variant appears in the template (catches Pattern #142 `statefarm`).
  Idempotent via the `low_mention_cleanup_revision = '2.5.13'` settings flag. Reversible per row (`is_active = 1` re-enables). Dry-run against the prod 177-pattern catalog before this release shipped: 29 rows would be disabled (26 low-mention auto-created never-matched + #227 + #202 + #142), and the eight `confirmation_count > 0` low-mention edge cases (`#238 SoFi conf=7`, `#87 Chubbiesshorts conf=5`, `#248 Just Another conf=3`, `#259 Athletic Brewing conf=2`, `#245 San Diego Tourism`, `#348 SilverMirror`, `#55 Pura`) are all kept. The migration runs the same way on any install regardless of pattern count or sponsor catalog.

### Changed

- **Boot banners now fire once per restart, not once per worker.** Gunicorn runs 2 workers; on the previous code every banner (`MinusPod v... starting`, `BASE_URL`, `LLM endpoint verified`, `LLM provider verified`, `OpenAI-compatible client initialized`, `Verifying LLM endpoint`, `Registered signal handlers`, `Web UI available`, `Pattern catalog`, `Rate limiter initialized`, `ProxyFix enabled`, `Existing database found ... running migrations`, `Created new tables for cross-episode training and processing history`) printed in both worker processes. The leader/follower gate already used for background-thread ownership now also gates the operator-facing banners. The follower emits one DEBUG line. Per-config banners that aren't operator-actionable (`Pattern catalog`, `Rate limiter initialized`, `ProxyFix enabled`, `Registered signal handlers`) drop to DEBUG entirely.
- **`Created new tables for cross-episode training and processing history`** is now gated on a sentinel check: the line only logs when `ad_reviewer_log` did not exist on this boot. Most boots it already does, so the line stays silent.
- **`Existing database found at ..., running migrations`** demoted to DEBUG. It fires every boot regardless of whether any migration produced a change.
- **`verify_llm_connection()` runs on the leader only.** All workers share the same host and network reachability, so the second verification request and the four duplicate INFO lines it produced were waste.
- **Periodic search index rebuild no longer logs twice.** The `rebuild_search_index()` method itself already emits `Search index rebuilt with N items`; the caller in `background.py` was emitting a near-identical `Periodic search index rebuild: N items indexed` immediately after. Caller's redundant log line removed.

## [2.5.12] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **Storage is now a singleton.** Mirrors the Database pattern. Every `/api/v1/health` call (the Portainer probe runs every 30s) used to construct a fresh `Storage()`, which logged `Storage initialized with data_dir: /app/data` each time. Production Loki was carrying ~120 of those lines per hour from one endpoint alone. The new `__new__` + `_initialized` guard short-circuits subsequent constructions; the init log fires once per process lifetime. Storage-backed tests (`test_versioned_mp3.py`, `test_path_containment.py`, `test_artwork_validation.py`) gained a fixture-level `Storage._instance = None` reset so each test still gets a fresh root.
- **Demote per-poll RSS-refresh INFO logs to DEBUG.** Steady-state refresh activity (every podcast, every poll cycle) was producing 8 INFO lines per feed per poll - `Starting RSS refresh from`, `Feed not modified (304)`, `Fetched RSS feed, size`, `Parsed RSS feed`, `Limiting feed from`, `[slug] Feed unchanged (304), skipping refresh`, `Detected: platform=`, `Updated podcast: platform=`, `[slug] RSS refresh complete` - none of which carry actionable information when nothing changed. They are now DEBUG. The aggregate `RSS refresh complete for N feeds` line and `Discovered N new episode(s)` line (gated on `inserted > 0`) stay at INFO.
- **`pricing_fetcher` no longer logs a refresh attempt at INFO when nothing will be fetched.** The line was followed immediately by `Provider is local/free -- no pricing to fetch` at DEBUG, so the INFO half was always noise.

### Fixed

- **RSS refresh no longer parses each feed XML three times per cycle.** `refresh_rss_feed` called `parse_feed` directly, then `extract_episodes` (which re-parsed internally), then `modify_feed` (which re-parsed again). Both `extract_episodes` and `modify_feed` gained an optional `parsed_feed` kwarg; when supplied, they skip the internal parse. The orchestrator now parses once and threads the result through. The 3-4 duplicate `Parsed RSS feed: NAME with N entries` lines per refresh cycle are gone (and the lines themselves are now DEBUG).

## [2.5.11] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **Reject reasoning-sentence values in the LLM-returned `sponsor` field.** Claude occasionally fills the `sponsor` slot of an ad object with a description of why the segment looks like an ad (e.g. `"Inferred from ~26 second gap in transcript with no spoken content provided"`) instead of a brand name. The downstream text-pattern matcher caught these and refused to create a pattern, but only after the bogus value had already propagated into the ad dict. `get_valid_value()` in `ad_detector/prompts.py` now drops any value that exceeds 60 characters, starts with one of the reasoning prefixes (`inferred from`, `based on`, `according to`, `likely `, `possibly `, `may be `, `appears to `, `seems to `, `detected as `, `classified as `), or contains an unambiguously meta substring (`in transcript`, `audio signal`, `no spoken content`, `gap in transcript`, `volume anomaly`). The ad survives; only the bogus sponsor field is dropped. Sentences that happen to embed a real brand name (e.g. `"...looks like a Capital One ad"`) still hit the existing fuzzy extractor and surface the brand as before.

## [2.5.10] - 2026-05-20

### Changed

- **Serialize schema migrations across gunicorn workers and stop the duplicate "Migration: Created X" log lines.** Both workers race the `Database.__init__` path on container start; the work is idempotent but each worker emits the same per-table creation log and doubles the SQLite write contention against the migrations block. Added an `fcntl.flock`-based file lock at `{data_dir}/.migration.lock` that wraps `_init_schema`, so worker B blocks until worker A finishes and then walks the already-stamped revision flags and short-circuits each gate. The pre-existing "database is locked" retry loop is kept as belt-and-suspenders for any other process holding a write lock. The four per-table "Migration: Created ..." log lines (auto_process_queue, FTS5 search_index, auth_failures, model_pricing + token_usage) are now gated on a sqlite_master pre-check so they only fire when the table genuinely did not exist before this boot.

## [2.5.9] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **Pattern detail modal: textarea now auto-grows to fit content, matching the view-mode height.** 2.5.8 gave view and edit the same `min-h-[160px] max-h-[400px]`, but textareas do not auto-grow with their content the way a `<div>` does, so the view-mode div would expand to ~360px to show a long template while the edit-mode textarea would stay pinned at 160px with internal scroll. User-visible result: the box still appeared to shrink on Edit and content had to be scrolled or the textarea hand-dragged. Added a useRef + useEffect that sets `textarea.style.height = min(scrollHeight, 400)` whenever the user toggles into edit mode or types into the field. View and edit now render at the same height for the same content.

## [2.5.8] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **Pattern detail modal: view-mode and edit-mode now render at the same size.** 2.5.7 dropped the textarea's fixed `rows={4}` and added `min-h-[160px] max-h-[400px]` to fix the shrink-on-edit case, but the view-mode `<div>` had no equivalent min/max, so for short templates the view collapsed to ~84px while edit jumped to 160px - the user-visible jump direction inverted instead of going away. The view-mode container now carries the same `min-h-[160px] max-h-[400px] overflow-auto` triple, so for any template length both modes render at an identical height. Verified on live server in Playwright.

## [2.5.7] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Transcript display corrections.** Whisper sometimes mis-transcribes drug and product names (e.g. "Wegovy" coming back as "WeGoV" or "we go V"). The `sponsor_normalizations` table now drives a case-preserving correction pass that runs once per episode, immediately after `transcribe_chunked()` returns. A new `SponsorService.apply_transcript_corrections()` method walks the cached rules, applies them with `re.IGNORECASE`, and leaves casing and whitespace outside the matched span untouched. A row whose `replacement` contains uppercase opts in to this code path; lowercase-only rows (matcher canonicalizations like `ag1`, `betterhelp`) are skipped. Seed rows for `WeGoV` and `we go v` -> `Wegovy` ship in `SEED_NORMALIZATIONS`. `Wegovy`, `Ozempic`, and `Mounjaro` are also added to `AD_VOCABULARY` so Whisper biases decoding toward the correct spellings up front. Future user-added corrections via `POST /sponsors/normalizations` with a mixed-case replacement Just Work.
- **Hulu theme.** New dark-only `id: 'hulu'` entry in `frontend/src/themes/themes.ts`. Hulu's signature green (`#1CE783`) drives `primary` and `ring`, set against deep cool-charcoal surfaces. Picked from Settings -> Appearance like every other theme.

### Fixed

- **Kitchen-sink ad patterns no longer over-match.** A sponsor pattern whose `text_template` happened to name several unrelated brands (the canonical example was Pattern #211, a JRE row that listed Athletic Greens, AG1, BetterHelp, Squarespace, ZipRecruiter, Raycon, Manscaped, and Stamps.com in one comma-separated blob) generated high-weight TF-IDF tokens for every brand, so any episode that mentioned two or three of them tripped the 0.70 cosine threshold and got marked as the row's sponsor. Two fixes ship together: (1) `PatternService.merge_similar_patterns()` now calls `find_foreign_sponsors()` on the chosen combined template before writing the merged row; if the template names any active sponsor outside the consolidated sponsor's name and aliases, the merge aborts and the source rows stay intact. (2) A one-shot migration (`_cleanup_multi_sponsor_patterns`) scans active `ad_patterns` on boot and disables any row whose template names two or more foreign sponsors, with `disabled_reason` set to a 2.5.7-tagged explanation. Idempotent against already-inactive rows; flipping `is_active=1` re-enables a row at any time.
- **Pattern-edit textarea no longer shrinks when entering edit mode.** `PatternDetailModal.tsx` was rendering edit mode as a `<textarea rows={4}>` while view mode was a flexible `<div>` with `p-3` and `whitespace-pre-wrap`. For any template longer than four wrapped lines (so, most of them), clicking Edit visibly collapsed the box. The textarea now uses `min-h-[160px] max-h-[400px]` with `resize-y` and matches the view-mode padding, so the box stays approximately the same height when toggling modes and the user can drag it taller if needed.
## [2.5.6] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **`<podcast:block>` and `<podcast:complete>` are now passed through verbatim instead of silently dropped.** A served-feed audit against the pc20 fixture revealed both tags fell into the "unknown podcast:* localname, skip" branch of `_parse_upstream_channel_pc2_tags`. Neither tag describes the original audio timeline or bytes, so neither belongs on the strip list, but both were missing from the passthrough allowlist. `podcast:block` carries the publisher's directory-block hints with an optional `id` attribute scoping the block to specific directories (e.g. `id="apple"`, `id="spotify"`, `id="amazon"`); stripping these would silently expose the re-feed in directories the publisher chose to keep it out of. `podcast:complete` is the show-finished boolean and is unaffected by ad removal. Both added to `_PC2_CHANNEL_PASSTHROUGH` and documented in `docs/podcasting-2.0.md`. New tests cover all-variants survival, self-closing-block payload preservation, and end-to-end emission against the live pc20 snapshot. No DB or schema changes; rollback is a plain image redeploy.

## [2.5.5] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **Reverted the 2.5.4 upstream-transcript/upstream-chapters passthrough.** 2.5.4 emitted per-episode `<podcast:transcript>` and `<podcast:chapters>` tags pointing at the publisher's CDN (e.g. `mp3s.nashownotes.com`, `reflex.livewire.io`) whenever MinusPod had not yet processed the episode. This violated the core MinusPod contract: subscribers to a proxied feed must reach MinusPod for all content, never the publisher. The served feed now emits these tags ONLY when MinusPod has its own regenerated VTT / JSON cached; unprocessed episodes carry no transcript or chapters URL. The audio enclosure path is unchanged (returns 503 + JIT-triggered processing, same as it always has). `_extract_per_episode_pc2_tags` and its tests are removed. New regression test `tests/unit/test_no_upstream_url_leak.py` asserts that the modified feed contains zero upstream URLs in either tag. Rollback: redeploy the prior image; no schema or cache changes.

## [2.5.4] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **Per-episode `<podcast:transcript>` and `<podcast:chapters>` are no longer dropped on unprocessed episodes.** Before this release, the served feed only emitted these tags when MinusPod had cached its own regenerated VTT/JSON for the episode. For feeds where many episodes are still in `discovered`/`processing` state (typical immediately after adding a podcast), MinusPod serves the original upstream audio through its enclosure URL, but stripped the upstream publisher's transcript and chapter references. Subscribers lost access to the publisher's transcripts and chapter markers entirely until each episode finished cut-processing. New behavior: when MinusPod has its own regenerated file the served URL points at it (cut-aligned timestamps); otherwise every per-item `<podcast:transcript>` and `<podcast:chapters>` from upstream is re-emitted verbatim with all attributes preserved (`url`, `type`, `language`, `rel`). pc20 served feed went from 0 to 193 per-episode transcript and chapter tags as a result. See `docs/podcasting-2.0.md` for the updated semantics.

## [2.5.3] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **Modified RSS now passes through standard RSS + iTunes channel metadata.** `modify_feed` only emitted `<title>`, `<link>`, `<description>`, `<language>`, and `<image>` at channel scope; every iTunes channel tag (`itunes:author`, `itunes:summary`, `itunes:owner`, `itunes:category`, `itunes:explicit`, `itunes:keywords`, `itunes:type`, `itunes:block`, `itunes:complete`, `itunes:subtitle`) plus standard RSS metadata (`managingEditor`, `webMaster`, `copyright`, `category`, `pubDate`, `ttl`, `docs`) was silently dropped. Apple Podcasts and most podcast apps require several of these to ingest the feed at all, so artwork would not render in apps even when the URL was reachable. A new `_emit_channel_metadata_passthrough` method walks channel-level direct children of the upstream XML and re-serializes the allowlisted tags under their canonical prefix, with strict same-namespace recursion (so nested `itunes:owner > itunes:name + itunes:email` survives intact).
- **`itunes:new-feed-url` is now explicitly stripped.** Apps interpret this tag as a "feed has moved" signal and migrate every subscriber to the URL it points at. Passing it through would silently redirect MinusPod subscribers back to the upstream feed.
- **Fresh `<lastBuildDate>` and `<generator>` emitted on every served feed.** Apps that use `lastBuildDate` to decide whether to re-fetch were seeing the upstream's stale timestamp and skipping refreshes. `<generator>` now reads `MinusPod` for attribution.
- **Episode list rows wrapped chip text mid-string at narrow widths.** Adding the show-artwork thumbnail to `EpisodeRow` in 2.5.2 reduced the meta-row's horizontal space; spans without `whitespace-nowrap` started wrapping inside (`2h\n39m`, `4 ads\ndetected`). The meta-row container now uses `flex-wrap` with column/row gaps, and each chip span has `whitespace-nowrap`, so chips wrap as whole units when needed.
- **"+ Add new ad" button on the no-ads-detected panel collapsed to a wrapped label on narrow viewports.** Mirrored the existing `AdReviewModal` pattern: plus-icon only on mobile, full label on `sm:+`. The button row has `gap-3` and the column has `shrink-0`/`min-w-0` so the description text doesn't squeeze the button.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-05-19

### Fixed

- **Channel artwork URL was being overridden by per-episode `itunes:image` tags.** feedparser flattens every `<itunes:image>` across the document into a single `feed.image.href`, so a feed that declares a proper 144x144 PNG at channel scope and a different image per episode (e.g. the Podcasting 2.0 reference feed pc20.xml, whose first episode references a 40 MB animated GIF) ended up with MinusPod storing the per-episode override as the show's "official" artwork. The retry-on-every-request artwork cache then burned ~200 ms per page load failing to cache the GIF against the size cap. `RSSParser.extract_podcast_artwork_url` now parses raw channel-level XML via defusedxml: it prefers `<itunes:image href="...">` as a direct child of `<channel>`, falls back to `<image><url>`, and never considers per-episode tags. Both callers (`refresh_rss_feed` and `_extract_artwork_url_from_feed`) now pass raw bytes.
- **Modified RSS had no channel-level `<itunes:image>` tag.** Apple Podcasts and most podcast players prefer this over the standard `<image>` block, so feeds whose web-UI artwork looked fine still showed no cover in subscribers' apps. `modify_feed` now emits both `<image>` AND `<itunes:image>` at channel scope using the URL returned by the new raw-XML extractor.
- **Artwork endpoint hammered upstream hosts on every request.** `GET /api/v1/feeds/<slug>/artwork` attempted a full re-download whenever the cached file was missing, even when the prior download had failed cleanly (size cap, content-type rejection, fetch error). Now only retries when `artwork_cached=1` (the "file went missing out from under us" case); when `cached=0`, returns 404 immediately and lets the 15-minute refresh cycle handle the retry.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-05-19

Tag `2.5.0` was published to Docker Hub but pulled stale bytes through a Portainer/registry cache layer on deploy. `2.5.1` is the first working release that ships the changes below. Treat `2.5.0` as withdrawn.



### Fixed

- **Feed-detail and episode-detail pages now render the channel description as plaintext.** `FeedDetail.tsx` rendered `{feed.description}` directly, while the existing `EpisodeList`/`EpisodeDetail` paths already pipe descriptions through `stripHtml()`. Feeds whose channel description contains HTML (typical: Wordpress-generated `<p>` blocks) were rendering literal `<p>` and `<strong>` tags as visible text. Same `stripHtml` helper now used at the feed-detail callsite.
- **Feed-detail and episode-detail pages now fall back to the upstream artwork URL when MinusPod's cache is empty.** Both pages hard-coded `src={`/api/v1/feeds/${slug}/artwork`}`, which serves a 404 (and the fallback grey-checkmark SVG) when the cached file is missing. `FeedCard` already preferred the API-supplied `artworkUrl` field (which is the upstream URL when `artwork_cached=0`); the detail pages now do the same.
- **Episode rows now display the show artwork as a thumbnail.** Previously each `EpisodeRow` showed only title + description + status. The 64x64 show-artwork thumbnail is threaded through `EpisodeList` from `FeedDetail` via a new optional `feedArtworkUrl` prop, falling back to the cached endpoint when no upstream URL is available.
- **Default artwork-cache size cap raised from 5 MB to 25 MB.** The 5 MB default was rejecting common 3000x3000 JPEG and PNG covers, leaving operators with a 404 from the artwork endpoint and the grey-checkmark fallback in the UI. Animated GIF covers over 25 MB (e.g. the Podcasting 2.0 reference feed ships a ~40 MB GIF) still get rejected at cache time; the frontend now falls back to the upstream URL for those. Operators concerned about per-feed disk usage can lower the cap with the existing `MINUSPOD_MAX_ARTWORK_BYTES` env var (floor 64 KB, hard ceiling 50 MB).
- **Add-feed slug auto-derivation failed silently on UA-strict feed hosts.** `fetch_feed` did not send `APP_USER_AGENT` to `safe_get` (only `fetch_feed_conditional` did), so the title-fetch step in `add_feed` returned None whenever a host (e.g. `feeds.podcastindex.org`) rejected the default `python-requests` UA with 403. The endpoint then refused to auto-derive a slug and forced the user to supply one manually. `fetch_feed` now passes `APP_USER_AGENT` on both the initial request and the gzip-decode retry, matching `fetch_feed_conditional`. As a defense-in-depth fallback, `add_feed` now also derives a slug from the URL path when the title fetch produces nothing, mirroring the OPML-import behavior. The duplicate URL-fallback block in `import_opml` was deduplicated into a shared `_slug_from_url_path` helper.
- **Channel `<description>` had no iTunes fallback.** Feeds with an empty upstream `<description>` rendered as a blank channel description even when `<itunes:summary>` carried the actual show description. A new `RSSParser._get_channel_description` helper mirrors the existing episode-level `description -> subtitle -> content` chain at channel scope (`description -> itunes:summary -> subtitle -> itunes:subtitle`). The fallback only triggers when upstream `<description>` is empty or whitespace; deliberately concise publisher-supplied descriptions are never overridden.

### Added

- **Channel-level Podcasting 2.0 tag handling.** Every served feed now emits a minted `podcast:guid` (deterministic UUIDv5 over the served URL, per the Podcast Namespace spec), a `podcast:locked` tag defaulting to `yes` when upstream is silent (discourages re-import of private re-feeds), and a `<podcast:txt purpose="ai-content">true</podcast:txt>` disclosure that the audio was algorithmically re-cut. Safe channel tags (`funding`, `podroll`, `license`, `medium`, `person`, `updateFrequency`, `season`, `episode`, `trailer`, `images`, `image`, `socialInteract`, `value`/`valueRecipient`/`valueTimeSplit`, free-form `txt`) pass through verbatim with attribute values re-escaped to prevent feed corruption from upstream `&` characters. The parser accepts every spec-equivalent xmlns URI form (canonical `podcastindex.org` plus both `github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/{main,master}/docs/1.0.md` forms and their `http://` variants), so feeds like the reference `pc20.xml` that declare the GitHub-blob URI are handled correctly. See [docs/podcasting-2.0.md](docs/podcasting-2.0.md) for the full pass/regenerate/strip rationale.
- **Strip list for channel tags that would lie about the re-cut audio.** `podcast:integrity`, `soundbite`, `liveItem`, `alternateEnclosure`, `source`, and any upstream `podcast:guid` are dropped from the served feed (MinusPod mints its own GUID). `podcast:txt` with `purpose="verify"` or `purpose="applepodcastsverify"` is also stripped to avoid leaking the upstream publisher's ownership token through MinusPod. `podcast:podping` is deliberately never emitted: Podping publishes the feed URL to a public blockchain, which is the wrong shape for private re-feeds.

### Changed

- **CPU image now ships as a multi-arch manifest covering `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` (issue #256).** Users on Raspberry Pi 5, Ampere, Graviton, M-series Macs, and other arm64 hosts can pull `ttlequals0/minuspod:<version>-cpu` or `:cpu` without docker-compose's amd64 emulation; Docker auto-selects the matching variant at pull time. GPU image (`Dockerfile`, `:<version>`, `:latest`) stays amd64-only because NVIDIA's arm64 CUDA images target Jetson, not generic arm64 cloud hosts.
- **CPU image build moves to a GitHub Actions workflow.** `.github/workflows/cpu-image.yml` runs the amd64 leg on `ubuntu-latest` and the arm64 leg on the free native `ubuntu-24.04-arm` runner (no QEMU), then merges both arch-specific digests into a single manifest list. Trigger: `gh workflow run cpu-image.yml -f version=<version>` after the GPU image lands; add `-f promote_cpu_tag=true` to also move the floating `:cpu` tag. Requires repo secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`. The local `/build-and-push` flow stays as GPU-only.
- **`docker-compose.cpu.yml` no longer pins `platform: linux/amd64`.** Docker now picks the matching arch from the published manifest list. Re-add the pin only to force amd64 emulation on an arm64 host.

## [2.4.20] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **Text-mode transcript selection now stays highlighted when focus moves into the Text template / Sponsor / Reason fields.** The browser clears the native Selection when focus moves out of the transcript region, which made the highlight disappear the moment the user clicked into the textarea below it. `TextSelectionPanel.tsx` now derives a `selectedRange` from `adStart`/`adEnd` and applies a `bg-primary/30` class to the in-range word spans, so the visual highlight survives focus changes, re-renders, and audio-mode pin drags.
- **Active text-selection drag is now visible on mobile (and more visible in dark mode generally).** The transcript container previously fell back to the browser default `::selection` color, which is near-invisible against a dark background on iOS Safari and Chrome Android. Added `selection:bg-primary/50 selection:text-primary-foreground` to the transcript root so the active drag color stands out during selection.

## [2.4.19] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed

- **Cancel/X on the Add-new-ad modal no longer reopens the Detected-ad modal underneath.** 2.2.6 added a `cameFromReviewRef` so that Cancel from create-mode would return the user to the review modal when create was entered via the in-modal `+ Add new ad` button. Users found the reappearing review modal more disruptive than helpful (the page-header path closed cleanly, but the in-modal path bounced them back into review). Both close paths now route to `onClose` and unmount the editor. Save still flips back to review via `handleCreateSubmit` so the user can keep working through a queue after committing an ad.

## [2.4.18] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- **Text-mode ad creation in the Add-new-ad modal.** A toggle at the top of the modal switches between `By audio` (the existing waveform-pin flow) and `By text`. In text mode the modal renders the original transcript with word-level timestamps, a client-side search with `N of M` match navigation, and native browser text selection that resolves the highlighted range to exact Whisper word timings. The resolved bounds and selected text populate the existing template + adStart/adEnd state, so toggling back to audio mode keeps the work and the optional Reason field stays editable. Backend was already in place: `GET /feeds/<slug>/episodes/<id>/original-segments` returns word-level `words[]` per segment.
- **Configurable detection-window geometry.** `window_size_seconds` and `window_overlap_seconds` are now tunables in Settings > LLM Tunables (defaults 600s / 180s, identical to prior behavior). Server-side bounds are size in `[120, 1800]` and overlap in `[0, 1770]`, with a cross-field validator that rejects overlap >= size. Lets small-context local LLM users shrink the window to fit. The two readers in `src/ad_detector/` resolve via `get_stage_tunable()` at call time so Settings UI changes take effect on the next episode without restart.
- **Reset-to-default UI for every stage tunable.** A `Reset` link sits beside each numeric input in `StageTunablesSection.tsx`, including the new window inputs and the existing temperature / max-tokens / reasoning budget / reasoning effort controls. Disabled when the value already matches the default or when an env var has pinned it.
- **Structural rate-limit detection and webhook event.** A new `EVENT_RATE_LIMIT_STRUCTURAL` webhook fires when a single LLM request's token count structurally exceeds the provider's per-minute cap (Groq free tier is the main triggering case). The retry loop in `src/utils/llm_call.py` short-circuits this case instead of consuming the full backoff budget, and the episode's `error_message` reports the limit, the requested count, and the two remedies (shrink the detection window in LLM Tunables, or change provider/tier).

### Changed

- **Renamed the settings section `LLM Tunables (per stage)` to `LLM Tunables`.** The window inputs are global, not per-stage; the old title no longer described the contents.

## [2.4.17] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Episode list checkbox was hard to tap on mobile; finger landed on the row Link instead.** The `Checkbox` component is a 16px square sitting inside a non-padded absolute wrapper; touchable area was the visible control only, well below the 44px iOS HIG minimum. Most mobile taps hit the surrounding `<Link>` and navigated into the episode, losing any in-progress selection. Replaced the wrapper with a 44x44 `<button>` that stops propagation, prevents default, and routes the tap to `onToggle`; the visible checkbox is centered inside. Bumped the row's left padding to clear the larger tap zone.

## [2.4.16] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Bulk action buttons in `FeedDetail.tsx` shifted size with the eligible count.** "Full Reprocess (N)" was wrapping onto two lines on narrow viewports while "Reprocess (N)" and "Delete (N)" stayed single-line, giving the toolbar an uneven look. Added `whitespace-nowrap` + `min-w-[8rem] text-center` so every button is the same width and never wraps regardless of the count.

## [2.4.15] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Bulk action toolbar hid Reprocess/Delete buttons on mixed-status selection.** `FeedDetail.tsx` required EVERY selected episode to share the same status group before showing the matching bulk button. A selection that mixed processed episodes with a stuck `pending` row (e.g. one queued via a prior bulk that the drainer dropped) collapsed to a "Mixed statuses" message, leaving only the feed-level "Reprocess All" dropdown in the header. Now shows each button with an eligibility count (`Reprocess (3)`, `Process (2)`, etc.) when at least one selected item matches; the backend already skips ineligible rows, so a mixed selection still does the right thing.

## [2.4.14] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Bulk `process` action on auto-process-disabled feeds was silently dropped.** The 2.4.12 fix that let user-initiated reprocesses bypass the background drainer's auto-process gate keyed on `reprocess_requested_at`, which is set by the single-episode and bulk `reprocess` / `reprocess_full` paths. The bulk `process` (first-time process) path did not set the field, so the drainer's bypass check still saw NULL and marked the row `completed` with reason "Auto-process disabled for this feed". Bulk `process` now stamps `reprocess_requested_at` like the other user-initiated paths, so first-time process from the UI on a disabled feed runs through normally.

## [2.4.13] - 2026-05-17

### Changed

- **`ad_patterns.source_language` column (#252).** Patterns are now stamped with the ISO 639-1 transcript language they were learned from (read from the `whisper_language` setting; `'auto'` leaves the column null for language-agnostic behavior). `text_pattern_matcher.find_matches` accepts a `language=` argument and excludes patterns whose `source_language` is set and differs; nulls match any language so existing rows behave as before. The community export bundle includes `source_language` so a Spanish pattern submitted from Mexico won't get treated as a generic English-corpus global pattern on import. Helper at `src/utils/language.py:get_pattern_language(db)`. Schema migration is additive and idempotent. Defense-in-depth metadata only -- runtime impact is minimal because TF-IDF already self-prunes across languages.

### Dependencies

- **pip**: `anthropic 0.100.0 -> 0.102.0`, `openai 2.36.0 -> 2.37.0`, `requests 2.33.1 -> 2.34.2`, `huggingface-hub 1.14.0 -> 1.15.0` (#251, #250, #249, #248).
- **npm**: `lucide-react 1.14.0 -> 1.16.0`, `swagger-ui-dist 5.32.5 -> 5.32.6`, `eslint 10.3.0 -> 10.4.0`, `typescript-eslint 8.59.2 -> 8.59.3`, `vite 8.0.10 -> 8.0.13` (#247, #246, #245, #244, #243).
- **GitHub Actions**: `actions/labeler 5.0.0 -> 6.1.0`, `actions/checkout 4.3.1 -> 6.0.2`, `actions/github-script 8.0.0 -> 9.0.0` (#242, #241, #240). Pins updated to commit SHA per the audit policy.

### Deferred

- **Ubuntu 24.04 -> 26.04 on `Dockerfile.cpu` (#208) deferred.** Ubuntu 26.04 is a non-LTS interim release and the deadsnakes PPA (which the CPU image uses to install Python 3.11) has not confirmed publishing for questing yet. CPU image stays on 24.04 LTS until either deadsnakes ships 26.04 binaries or the image switches to `python:3.11-slim` and skips the PPA entirely. PR #208 stays open as a tracking placeholder.

## [2.4.12] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **User reprocesses on auto-process-disabled feeds were silently dropped.** The background queue drainer (`src/main_app/background.py`) checked `is_auto_process_enabled_for_podcast` for every row and marked it `completed` with reason "Auto-process disabled" if the feed was disabled. This was the right behavior for RSS auto-discovery but blocked explicit user reprocesses too. The drainer now reads the episode row and bypasses the gate when `reprocess_requested_at` is set, so a user-initiated reprocess on a disabled feed runs through normally. RSS auto-discovery behavior is unchanged.
- **Legacy reprocess endpoint now sets `reprocess_requested_at`.** Previously only the mode-aware endpoint at `POST /episodes/<slug>/<id>/reprocess` set this field; the legacy `POST /feeds/<slug>/episodes/<id>/reprocess` did not. Both endpoints now write it, so the drainer's user-initiated detection works regardless of which endpoint the frontend hits.

### Changed

- **`GET /api/v1/episodes/processing` now also surfaces queued episodes (waiting on the lock).** Items appear with `stage="queued"` and a `queuedAt` timestamp alongside the currently-processing entry. The reprocess endpoints register the queued episode with `StatusService.queue_episode` after enqueuing into `auto_process_queue`, so the top banner's `queueLength` / `queuedEpisodes` and the Settings queue panel both show "what's coming next".

## [2.4.11] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Reprocess silently skipped when episode already in `auto_process_queue`.** The two single-episode reprocess endpoints (`POST /feeds/<slug>/episodes/<id>/reprocess` and `POST /episodes/<slug>/<id>/reprocess`) called `queue_episode_for_processing`, which uses `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. When the queue already had a `failed` row for the episode from a prior run, the re-queue was a no-op: `episodes.status` flipped to `pending` but the background queue processor never picked the episode up. Both endpoints now use `upsert_episode_for_processing`, which resets the existing row to `status='pending'` with `attempts=0`. The bulk endpoint already used the upsert helper; this brings the single-episode endpoints in line. Episodes stuck in pending limbo from a previous reprocess need to be reprocessed again after this release.

## [2.4.10] - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- **Issue #235 (Transcription URL reset on Save).** `PUT /api/v1/settings/providers/<name>` no longer wipes the stored base URL when the request body contains `baseUrl: ""`. The empty value is now ignored so a pre-hydration `handleProviderKeySave` (issue #234's co-persist path) cannot clear a previously-saved URL. To explicitly clear, use `DELETE /api/v1/settings/providers/<name>`, which now also clears `cfg['base_url']` alongside the secret. The frontend `handleProviderKeySave` mirrors the guard and only sends `baseUrl` when local state is non-empty.
- **Issue #236 / #237 (banner says processing while Settings queue says empty).** `GET /api/v1/episodes/processing` now merges the DB rows (`episodes.status='processing'`) with `StatusService.current_job` from `processing_status.json`. The Settings panel and the top banner share a source of truth, so a worker that is mid-`Pass 1: Detecting ads (M/N)` shows up in both places instead of the panel saying "No episodes currently processing".
- **Issue #237 (negative LLM cost, e.g. `$-76,579`).** `database.SettingsMixin.upsert_fetched_pricing` rejects rows with negative `input_cost_per_mtok` / `output_cost_per_mtok` and warns with the source. `database.StatsMixin._calculate_token_cost` clamps a pre-existing negative row to zero (with a WARN per call) so legacy DBs stop accumulating a wrong-sign running total in `stats.total_llm_cost`. Operators should `UPDATE model_pricing SET input_cost_per_mtok=0 WHERE input_cost_per_mtok < 0;` (and the same for `output_cost_per_mtok`) to silence the warning permanently, then re-fetch pricing.
- **Issue #238 (HTTP 429 treated as permanent failure).** Two changes: `ad_detector.process_transcript` now preserves the last underlying error type and status code in the all-windows-failed return (instead of the generic `"All N windows failed"` that swallowed 429 context). `processing._handle_processing_failure` then routes rate-limit failures through a new branch that retries WITHOUT incrementing `retry_count`, so a sustained provider 429 no longer chews through `MAX_EPISODE_RETRIES` and pushes the episode to `PERMANENTLY_FAILED`. The check uses the existing `llm_client.is_rate_limit_error` helper.

### Docs

- **`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` rewritten for accuracy:** dropped the duplicate env-var table (`environment-variables.md` is the canonical reference) and added a "minimum production env" section pointing to `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `BASE_URL`, `APP_PASSWORD`, `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` plus the `MINUSPOD_TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` requirement behind any reverse proxy. Fixed the health-response shape (no `queue_available` key). Replaced the incorrect "automatic backup every 24 hours" claim with the actual `GET /api/v1/system/backup` flow (rate-limited 6/h, AES-GCM when `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` is set) plus a manual `tar` snapshot recipe. Added the CPU image variant to the Updating section.

## [2.4.9] - 2026-05-16

### Security

- **Session is now rotated on login and password change.** `session.clear()` runs before re-setting `permanent=True` and `authenticated=True` on `/auth/login` and `/auth/password`, so a pre-auth cookie can't ride the new authenticated state (session fixation). `SameSite=Strict` + `Secure` already mitigated but did not eliminate the window; this closes it.
- **`/auth/logout` now requires a valid CSRF token.** The route stays in `AUTH_EXEMPT_PATHS` so an expired session can still call it, but the handler validates the double-submit token manually. Unauthenticated callers continue to bypass (csrf.validate returns None when session.authenticated is False), preserving the "always callable to clear stale state" property.
- **Startup refuses to run when the Flask secret key cannot be coordinated.** If both the lockfile fallback AND the DB write fail, `get_or_create_secret_key()` now raises `SecretKeyUnavailableError` instead of warn-and-continue with a divergent key. Operators can bypass by setting `SECRET_KEY` via env.
- **JSON responses now ship `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'`.** Matches the lockdown already applied to `/feed/*` RSS. Closes a small corner where a JSON endpoint mistakenly returned `text/html` would have been CSP-less.
- **`/api/v1/patterns/import` mode validation moved to the route boundary** so the request -> bound-check -> response flow is visible to static analyzers; closes a py/reflective-xss false positive raised by CodeQL against a helper-side narrowing.
- **`community_sync._fetch_manifest` now routes through `safe_http.safe_get(trust=OPERATOR_CONFIGURED)` with a 256 KB cap.** The manifest URL is a build-time constant today, but the wrapper protects any future setting that exposes it.
- **`entrypoint.sh`** added `-xdev` to both `find` calls and a pre-check warning when `$DATA_DIR` is owned by a uid that's neither 0 nor `$APP_UID`. Warning-only this release so we see behavior on existing volumes before tightening to fatal.
- **Container hardening:** `docker-compose.yml` and `docker-compose.cpu.yml` now set `security_opt: ["no-new-privileges:true"]` and `cap_drop: [ALL]` on the `minuspod` service. App already runs as UID 1000 via `setpriv`; no caps needed after start.
- **Build reproducibility:** pinned `pip==25.2` and `setuptools==80.9.0` in both `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.cpu`.
- **Supply-chain:** every `actions/*` and third-party GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/*.yml` pinned to a commit SHA (human-readable tag kept as a comment). Closes the floating-major-tag exposure flagged in the audit.
- **Pre-commit hook:** ASCII-glyph guard blocks em-dashes, smart quotes, and U+2605; Bearer-token regex post-filtered to skip common placeholder strings (example/placeholder/test/your-/fixture/sample/dummy/fake/redacted/xxxxx).
- **RSS DOCTYPE pre-scan widened from 4 KB to 64 KB** so feeds with extensive leading whitespace still surface the `xml_forbidden_construct` warning. `defusedxml.defuse_stdlib()` still gates XXE.
- **66 em-dashes and 1 U+2605 swept from code/docs/UI** (ASCII-only). Future regressions blocked by the new pre-commit guard.

### Refactor (no behavior change)

- **`src/ad_detector.py` split into `src/ad_detector/` package**: `__init__.py` (AdDetector class + 28 public re-exports), `boundaries.py` (refine/extend/snap/merge/validate/dedupe), `prompts.py` (USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE, create_windows, format_window_prompt, get_static_system_prompt, parse_ads_from_response). Central file dropped 2575 -> 1403 LOC. Git records the rename so blame survives.
- **`src/database/schema.py` split into `src/database/schema/` package**: pure code-motion, SQL DDL constants moved to `tables.py`. SHA-256 of `SCHEMA_SQL` and `MIGRATION_INDEXES_SQL` identical before/after. 92 migration-focused tests pass.
- **`frontend/src/components/AdReviewModal.tsx`** decomposed: helpers moved to `frontend/src/utils/adReviewHelpers.ts`, `Pin` subcomponent to `frontend/src/components/ad-editor/Pin.tsx`, peaks logic to `usePeaks` hook. 1654 -> 1448 LOC. Public surface unchanged.
- **`src/main_app/processing.py`** four pipeline-stage helpers decomposed: `_run_ad_reviewer` 95 -> 67, `_refine_and_validate` 124 -> 67, `_finalize_episode` 109 -> 26, `_run_verification_pass` 157 -> 93. Every audio_logger call preserved verbatim.
- **`src/ad_detector.learn_from_detections`** decomposed 151 -> 52 LOC into four phase helpers (`_ad_passes_learning_filters`, `_resolve_sponsor_for_learning`, `_sponsor_blocked_by_gates`, `_create_pattern_and_fingerprint`).
- **`src/api/settings.update_ad_detection_settings`** decomposed 263 -> 34 LOC dispatcher across nine `_apply_*_fields` phase helpers.
- **`src/api/patterns.py`** three large handlers decomposed: `submit_correction` 247 -> 44 (orchestrator over five handlers), `_submit_correction_create` 120 -> 77, `import_patterns` 136 -> 40.
- **EpisodeContext dataclass** (`src/main_app/episode_context.py`) shrinks pipeline parameter lists: `_detect_ads_first_pass` 11 -> 6 params, `_run_verification_pass` 13 -> 7, `_apply_pass2_reviewer` 12 -> 6.
- **`src/main_app/_get_components()` tuples replaced with direct singleton imports** in processing.py, routes.py, background.py, feeds.py. Eliminates the silent tuple-reorder failure mode.
- **Helper consolidation**: new `src/utils/ttl_cache.py` (cleanup_service, llm_client, sponsor_service now share it), `overlap_ratio` + `ranges_overlap` in `src/utils/time.py`, `NON_BRAND_WORDS` consolidated to `src/utils/constants.py`, sponsor extraction consolidated to `SponsorService`.
- **Frontend helper consolidation**: `Artwork.tsx` + `ARTWORK_FALLBACK_SVG` (was duplicated 4x), `useLocalStorageState` hook (was hand-rolled 4x), `useSyncFromQuery` hook (replaces three Settings.tsx snapshot blocks), `NAV_ITEMS` table + `<NavLink>` in `Layout.tsx` (14 link blocks -> 6 entries; 234 -> 156 LOC), `DETECTION_STAGE_META` lookup, `apiFileRequest` helper (four blob downloads consolidated).
- **Type tightening**: `PatternScope` union, `EpisodeStatus(str, Enum)`, `SettingEntry` dataclass.
- **Dead code removed**: `INVALID_SPONSOR_REASONS` alias, `network_id` parameter from `process_transcript` (never supplied by any caller; downstream `text_pattern_matcher.find_matches` keeps it because other call sites use it).
- **Inline imports hoisted** in `src/api/episodes.py` (audio_peaks, chapters_generator, llm_client, processing_queue), `src/api/feeds.py` (urllib.parse, defusedxml), `src/audio_fingerprinter.py` (acoustid lifted to single module-level guarded import).

### Tooling (benchmark; not in runtime image)

- **Benchmark report scatter plots now assign a unique color per model.** `_render_pareto`, `_render_precision_recall_chart`, and `_render_token_efficiency_chart` were drawing from `tab20` with `i % 20`, so any run with more than 20 models silently reused colors. Added `_distinct_colors(n)` that concatenates `tab20 + tab20b + tab20c` (60 categorical colors) and falls back to evenly-spaced `hsv` past that.

## [2.4.8] - 2026-05-15

### Security

- **Replaced `gosu` with `setpriv` in `entrypoint.sh` and dropped the `gosu` package from both GPU and CPU images.** Clears 50 Go stdlib CVEs (3 CRITICAL, 19 HIGH, 26 MEDIUM, 2 LOW) that Ubuntu 24.04's `gosu 1.17` carries because it was compiled against Go stdlib 1.22.2. `setpriv` ships with `util-linux` in the base image, has no Go runtime, and is the upstream-recommended gosu alternative. The privilege-drop flags match gosu's defaults: `--reuid=minuspod --regid=minuspod --init-groups --inh-caps=-all`. The two remaining torch CVEs (local DoS, LOW + MEDIUM) need a torch 2.6.0 -> 2.8.0 upgrade and are tracked separately.

## [2.4.7] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- **Detection-note line on the episode page is now prefixed with "Match:"** so it reads as the matcher's rationale instead of looking like a contradicting sponsor when the field carries free-text reviewer notes (e.g. boundary extension that sweeps adjacent ads into one detection, where `reason` ends up describing the tail brand while `sponsor` is the matched pattern's brand).

### Fixed

- **Community patterns now import with `scope='global'` instead of preserving the source instance's scope.** Pre-2.4.7 the export pipeline copied the source pattern's `scope` (almost always `'podcast'`) into the bundle, and the import pipeline used it verbatim. Since `podcast_id` is stripped on export, the imported row was scope='podcast' with `podcast_id=NULL` and never matched anything. Tag eligibility (`text_pattern_matcher._filter_patterns_by_scope`) is what actually gates community patterns per podcast; the legacy scope column should just be `global`.
- **Migration repairs existing community rows.** `_normalize_community_scope` UPDATEs every `source='community'` row to `scope='global'`, clears `podcast_id` / `network_id`. Stamped via `community_scope_revision`; idempotent.
- **12 seed bundle files in `patterns/community/`** were rewritten from `scope: podcast` to `scope: global`. Manifest regenerated. Earlier 2.4.0-2.4.6 syncs pulled them with scope=podcast; the migration above re-stamps those rows on the next container start.

## [2.4.6] - 2026-05-15

### Fixed

- **intro/outro_variants no longer get double-JSON-encoded on auto-created patterns.** `text_pattern_matcher` was calling `db.create_ad_pattern(intro_variants=json.dumps([intro]))` while the DB layer also `json.dumps`'d its input, so the column stored `'"[\\"text\\"]"'`. Submitting any of those patterns through the community bundle pipeline exploded the value into a list of single characters (the user's first bundle had `intro_variants` of length 196 starting with `['[', '"', 'E', 'm', ...]`). Now the matcher passes a plain list and the DB layer encodes once.
- **Migration repairs existing rows.** A one-shot `_repair_double_encoded_variants` migration re-encodes any `ad_patterns.intro_variants` / `outro_variants` whose stored value parses to a string (instead of a list) on the first `json.loads`. Idempotent; stamped via the `variant_reencode_revision` setting. Operators on 2.4.5 with broken rows will see them fix themselves on next container start.
- **Community export pipeline is defensive about the same bug.** `_safe_parse_variants` in `community_export.py` retries the decode when the first parse returns a string, so bundles built from a not-yet-migrated DB still produce clean output.

### Changed

- Dialog CLI snippet now hints `gh pr create --fill --label pattern` so the label gets requested directly. The labeler workflow still applies it automatically on path match; this is belt-and-suspenders.

## [2.4.5] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- **Submit-to-community is now a bundle download, not N prefilled PR tabs.** Picking "Submit to community" in the Export dialog opens a preview that lists which patterns will pass quality gates and which will not (with reasons). Confirming downloads a single `minuspod-submission-<id>.json` containing every passing pattern. You open one PR for the whole bundle in your fork. The old per-tab flow fell over at scale: 215 selected -> 8 tabs survived the popup blocker, 20 forced JSON downloads (each over the 7 KB URL limit), 187 silent 400s rendered as `[object Object]`.
- The PR-side validator and the manifest builder both handle the new bundle format (`format: minuspod-community-submission`) by flattening `patterns[]` into per-pattern validations / manifest entries. Existing per-file submissions still work.

### Added

- `POST /api/v1/patterns/preview-export` returning ready / rejected counts plus per-id rejection reasons.
- `POST /api/v1/patterns/submit-bundle` returning the downloadable bundle JSON. Includes `X-Bundle-Pattern-Count` and `X-Bundle-Rejected-Count` headers for the UI.

### Fixed

- **`POST /api/v1/community-patterns/sync` no longer returns 502 when the upstream manifest URL doesn't exist yet.** A 404 from `raw.githubusercontent.com` (e.g. the patterns feature is still on a branch and `main` doesn't have `patterns/community/index.json`) now returns 200 with `{status: "no_manifest_yet"}`. Other failures still surface as 502. Caught from the user's console showing six 502s.
- **`apiRequest` no longer stringifies error response bodies as `[object Object]`.** Backend 4xx responses can be `{error: {message: "...", reasons: [...]}}`; the old throw passed that object verbatim into `new Error(...)`. `extractErrorMessage` now prefers `error.error.message`, falls back to a stringified `error.error`, then the HTTP status. Affects every API call site.

## [2.4.4] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- **Bulk submit-to-community in the Export dialog.** The per-pattern "Submit to community" buttons on the Patterns page are gone. The Export button now opens one dialog with a destination radio: Download as JSON (the existing flow) or Submit to community (opens one prefilled PR per selected pattern). Patterns whose source is already `community` are filtered out automatically; round-tripping them is pointless.
- **Remove all community patterns.** Settings -> Community Patterns has a destructive action that wipes every `source='community'` row on this instance, including any you marked Protect from sync. Local and imported patterns are untouched. If sync is enabled, the next tick repopulates from the manifest. API: `DELETE /api/v1/community-patterns/all`, returns `{deleted: N}`.
- **Single-pattern check in the PR validator.** Community submissions must describe one ad. The validator now rejects a PR if `text_template` mentions any other seed sponsor by name or alias. Closes the gap on the import side; the export side already had the same check. See `patterns/CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Seeded `patterns/community/` with 12 initial patterns** (Capital One, Carvana x2, Instacart, Kayak, Mint Mobile, Monday.com, Progressive, SimpliSafe, Squarespace, ThreatLocker, Zyn). Pulled from a real instance export, cleaned up by hand, now in the published manifest. Earlier instances on this version pick them up on the next sync tick.

## [2.4.3] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **Fingerprint slow-fallback no longer burns 10 minutes when the audio is bad for fpcalc.** When `_generate_full_fingerprint` fails (e.g. fpcalc rejects an MP3 with "Invalid data found when processing input"), the per-window fallback used to inherit the full 600-second timeout: every window scan also called fpcalc, almost always produced zero new matches, and ate the entire budget before timing out. The fallback now caps at 90 seconds via a new `FALLBACK_SLOW_TIMEOUT` constant. Stage 1 still tries; it just doesn't block Stage 2 + Stage 3 for ten minutes on broken audio. Caught from production logs (cordkillers-only-audio episode that took 14 min on pass 1 alone).
- **`processing_timeouts._resolve` was silently falling back to env / defaults every refresh tick.** The `from database import get_database` import is invalid (`get_database` lives in the `api` package) and the try/except swallowed the resulting ImportError. Fixed the import path. Effect: user-configured `processing_soft_timeout_seconds` / `processing_hard_timeout_seconds` are now actually read from the DB instead of being silently shadowed by env-var fallbacks.
- **`community_sync` no longer WARNs every 15 minutes when the manifest URL returns 404.** A 404 is the expected state when upstream hasn't published a manifest yet (e.g., the feature branch hasn't merged to main). Now logged at INFO level with an explanatory message. Non-404 fetch failures still log as WARNING so real problems stay visible.
- **`set_podcast_tags` short-circuits the episode-aggregation pass when the incoming RSS tags are already covered by the row's union.** Pre-fix: every feed refresh on a 300-episode podcast did one SELECT + 300 JSON parses across all episodes even when nothing was going to change. Now a single subset check before the heavy work. Materially lower SQLite write contention with the queue processor on instances with large feeds.

## [2.4.2] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **Reviewer-trim now actually trims** instead of rebuilding the template from one episode's transcription. `rewrite_pattern_from_bounds` takes the original AND new bounds, computes the head/tail transcript slices, and splices them out of the existing `text_template` only when they appear at its start/end. The earlier behavior (Operation 2 "full replace within threshold") was a misnomer: it fit the template to a single episode and risked breaking matches on episodes that had captured the cleaner version. `intro_variants` / `outro_variants` get the same prefix/suffix trim so they stay aligned. Returns False when neither head nor tail slice matches the existing template, leaving the pattern untouched.
- **`community_sync.apply_manifest` now reads `manifest['vocabulary_version']`.** When the manifest carries a vocabulary newer than the app's, the sync writes a warning to the log and a `vocabulary_warning` field into `community_sync_last_summary` so the operator can spot a stale image. Non-integer values are caught and logged cleanly instead of crashing the sync.
- **Hardcoded `ttlequals0/MinusPod` is now a single constant.** `GITHUB_REPO` and `COMMUNITY_MANIFEST_URL` live in `src/utils/community_tags.py`; the export pipeline and sync job both import from there. One source of truth for the upstream identity.
- **`MANIFEST_VERSION` and `VOCABULARY_VERSION` moved out of `src/tools/generate_manifest.py`** (a build-time CLI) into `src/utils/community_tags.py` next to the vocabulary loader. Both the generator and the sync job import from there. Removes a wrong-direction runtime -> build-time layering import.
- **`pattern_service.py` no longer imports from `api/`.** Switched the transcript helper to `from utils.text import extract_text_in_range` directly. Service layer importing from API layer was the wrong dependency direction and would have become a circular import.

### Added

- **`.github/workflows/labeler.yml`** wiring `actions/labeler@v5` to apply `.github/labeler.yml` on PRs. The path-glob for `pattern` existed since 2.4.0 but nothing invoked it; community-pattern PRs will now get the label automatically.

## [2.4.1] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **Per-feed tag editor.** New "Tags" card on every feed-detail page. Shows the effective tag set grouped by source (RSS / episode / user), with an "+ Add tag" button that opens a grouped picker of the remaining vocabulary tags. User-added tags carry an inline X to remove them, and saves are auto-applied via `PUT /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/tags`. This was the missing companion UI to the backend endpoint shipped in 2.4.0.
- **Multi-select pattern export.** The Patterns page **Export** button now opens a dialog with a checkbox per pattern (Select-all, optional include-disabled / include-corrections flags) instead of dumping the whole local pattern DB. `GET /api/v1/patterns/export` gained an `?ids=1,2,3` filter to support this.
- **Per-row Submit-to-community / Protect-from-sync buttons in the desktop pattern table.** Previously only the mobile card layout had these, so desktop reviewers had to switch viewports. New 9th "Actions" column hosts them.
- **`GET /api/v1/tags/vocabulary`**: returns the canonical 49-tag vocabulary plus per-tag descriptions, grouped into podcast_genres / sponsor_industries / special_tags. Used by the new tag picker.

### Changed

- Tag vocabulary loading is now cached (`utils.community_tags.vocabulary_payload` with `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)`); the CSV is parsed once at process start instead of per request. Frontend cache: `staleTime: Infinity` since vocabulary ships with the app image.
- `/tags/vocabulary` lives at `src/api/tags.py` (was inline in `sponsors.py`); no behavior change, better discoverability.
- TypeScript now exports `PATTERN_SOURCES` and `PatternSource` from `frontend/src/api/patterns.ts`, mirroring the Python `PATTERN_SOURCES` frozenset, so frontend and backend can no longer drift on source-discriminator spellings.

### Fixed

- **`community_sync.apply_manifest` version stamping**: was using `dict.setdefault('version', manifest_version)` which silently kept a stale `version` carried in the inner `data` dict. Now assigns unconditionally so the manifest's version is authoritative for the `import_community_pattern` version gate.
- **CodeQL py/reflective-xss in bulk-op endpoints**: hardened `_resolve_bulk_target` so `ids` and `expected_count` are coerced to integers up front. Non-integer payloads return 400 with a clean message instead of being f-stringed into the response body.
- **Inline CREATE TABLE shape drift**: `_create_new_tables_only` definitions for `ad_patterns` and `known_sponsors` were missing the 2.4.0 columns; brought back into sync with `SCHEMA_SQL`. End state was already correct via the ALTER TABLE migrations, but the "must match SCHEMA_SQL exactly" comment invariant is now true again.
- **Sponsor reseed migration order**: moved `_reseed_known_sponsors` to run AFTER `_migrate_sponsor_fk` and the Zyn cleanups so it operates on the post-dedup canonical state. Previously a v2.1.x -> 2.4.x jump could let dedup discard the freshly-tagged row.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-14

### Added

- **Community ad patterns.** Patterns can now be shared via the `patterns/community/` directory in the GitHub repository. A new "Submit to community" button on each local pattern row runs an export pipeline (quality gates, PII strip, sponsor classification, metadata strip) and opens a prefilled GitHub PR. A new GitHub Action validates incoming PRs against the same gates and a three-tier dedupe (95%+ duplicate, 75-95% variant, <75% distinct) before the maintainer reviews them.
- **49-tag vocabulary + tagging system.** Sponsors and podcasts now carry tags from a 48-entry vocabulary (`src/seed_data/tag_vocabulary.csv`) plus a special `universal` flag for sponsors with broad appeal. Community patterns only enter the text-matching loop when their sponsor's tags overlap the podcast's tags, when the sponsor is `universal`, or when either side has no tags. Local patterns bypass tag filtering entirely.
- **Authoritative sponsor seed.** A new schema migration loads 255 sponsors (with aliases and tags) from `src/seed_data/sponsors_final.csv`. Migration semantics: UPDATE on name match (preserves `ad_patterns.sponsor_id` FKs), INSERT new, soft-delete (`is_active=0`) any pre-existing sponsor whose name is not in the seed.
- **Auto-pull / sync.** Optional opt-in: when enabled, the server polls `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ttlequals0/MinusPod/main/patterns/community/index.json` on a configurable cron (default Sunday 3am UTC) and applies INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE against community patterns. The new "Protect from sync" toggle on each community pattern row pins it so a future manifest can't overwrite or delete it.
- **Reviewer-trim auto-rewrite.** When a reviewer narrows an ad's bounds by more than the configurable trim threshold (default 20 s), the local pattern's `text_template` and intro/outro variants are re-extracted from the new transcript bounds. Off by default for community patterns; toggleable in the new **Ad Reviewer** settings panel.
- **iTunes category parsing.** RSS feed refresh now extracts `<itunes:category>` at both podcast and episode level and maps it through `src/seed_data/itunes_category_map.json` to the vocabulary tags above.
- **API additions** under `/api/v1/`: `POST /patterns/bulk-delete`, `POST /patterns/bulk-disable` (both guarded by `confirm: true` + `expected_count`), `POST /patterns/{id}/submit-to-community`, `POST | DELETE /patterns/{id}/protect`, `GET | PUT /feeds/{slug}/tags`, `PUT /sponsors/{id}/tags`, `GET | PUT /settings/reviewer`, `GET | PUT /settings/community-sync`, `POST /community-patterns/sync`, `GET /community-patterns/sync-status`. Documented in `openapi.yaml` (now at version 2.4.0).
- **Frontend additions.** Patterns page gains an Import/Export header pair, a Source filter (Local / Community / Imported), a community badge on each community-sourced row, per-row Submit-to-community / Protect-from-sync buttons, and a last-synced indicator with manual refresh. Settings page gains two new sections: **Ad Reviewer** (toggle + threshold) and **Community Patterns** (enable, cron, Sync Now, last-sync display).
- **GitHub workflow + path labeler** for community PRs (`.github/workflows/validate-community-patterns.yml`, `.github/labeler.yml`). Validator is also a CLI: `python -m tools.community_pattern_validator --pr-files X.json Y.json --comment-output /tmp/comment.md`.

### Changed

- `known_sponsors`, `podcasts`, `episodes` now carry a JSON `tags` column; `ad_patterns` carries `source`, `community_id`, `version`, `submitted_app_version`, `protected_from_sync`. Migration is additive and idempotent.
- Editing a community pattern in the UI now auto-sets `protected_from_sync=1` so the next sync run doesn't clobber the edit.

## [2.3.4] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Jump button opened the wrong ad.** The button only set the audio seek position; the modal still rendered whichever ad was at `editorSelectedAdIndex` (defaulting to 0). The fix passes the row's index alongside the seek time. As a regression guard, `modalKey` in `AdEditor` now also includes `selectedAdIndex`, so the modal remounts when the index changes.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- **Made the play scrubber actually look like a scrubber.** 2.3.2 shipped a thin tan rectangle that didn't read as interactive. Now: bordered track, primary-color playback fill, a circular thumb at the playhead position (scales on hover/focus), taller bar (`h-3`) for easier click/touch targeting, window indicator demoted to a muted gray band so it doesn't compete with the playback fill.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- **Edit Ads now defaults to a small window around the detected ad again** (+/-30s context, capped at 360s). 2.3.1 made every open default to the full episode, which lost the boundary-detail view that made review-mode useful in the first place. Create-new-ad still defaults to the full episode. If the user types a far-away timestamp in review mode, the window auto-expands to include the new pin.

### Added

- **Full-episode play scrubber** under the zoom slider. Click or drag anywhere on the bar to jump to that point in the audio, regardless of how the waveform is zoomed. Two overlapping fills: a dim band shows the slice currently rendered in the waveform; a brighter fill tracks playback. Keyboard: Arrow keys seek +/-5s, Shift+Arrow +/-10s, Home/End jump to ends. Pointer move is rAF-coalesced so dragging doesn't thrash the audio element.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Ad editor waveform defaulted to a 6-minute view**, so on long episodes the pins jumped off-screen the moment you typed real timestamps. Default now spans the full episode. When zoomed in, typing a time outside the viewport scrolls the wavesurfer to bring the pin into view.
- **Time inputs auto-reset on blur** when Start > End, blocking you from typing Start=34:50 then End=37:20. Each input now clamps only to `[0, episodeDuration]`. Cross-field validation moves to Save: invalid selection disables Save, reds the inputs, and shows an inline error.
- **No playback speed control** in the ad editor. Added a 0.5x-2x dropdown next to the play button.

### Changed

- Trimmed the helper text on the "LLM Tunables (per stage)" Settings section.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **Per-stage LLM tunables (#222).** Temperature, max_tokens, and reasoning controls per pass: ad detection (pass 1), reviewer, verification (pass 2), chapter boundary detection, and chapter title generation. The reviewer uses one set of values across both of its invocations. Reasoning is provider-aware: Anthropic takes a numeric token budget (1024-65536) that maps to the `thinking` block; OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Ollama take an effort enum (`none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`). Budget and level live in separate DB keys so a value set on one provider survives switching to another and back.
- **4xx fallback on rejected tunables.** When the provider returns 4xx because the user's values don't fit the model, the call is logged at WARNING and retried once with built-in defaults. The flag is keyed by `(episode_id, pass_name)` so parallel episodes don't share state. It clears at the start of the next pass.
- **Ollama context window (`OLLAMA_NUM_CTX`).** Ollama defaults to a small context (often 2048) and silently drops prompt text that doesn't fit, so ad detection fails with no visible error. Setting this to the model's trained context limit (8192+) avoids that.
- Env vars for every tunable; setting one makes the matching control read-only in Settings with a note pointing at the variable. Full list in `.env.example`.
- OpenAPI: 21 new fields on the `/settings/ad-detection` PUT payload and the Settings GET response.

### Changed

- Settings key `ad_detection_max_tokens` is migrated to `detection_max_tokens` on first startup. The old `AD_DETECTION_MAX_TOKENS` env var still works as an alias for `DETECTION_MAX_TOKENS`.

### Internal

- New module `src/llm_capabilities.py` for per-pass fallback state, the defaults registry, and provider-aware reasoning translation. Pulled out of `llm_client.py` so the client stays focused on the SDK plumbing.
- `LLMClient.messages_create` gains `reasoning_effort`, `episode_id`, and `pass_name`. Both `AnthropicClient` and `OpenAICompatibleClient` handle the fallback retry inline (the request shapes differ enough that sharing the body is more confusing than helpful).
- Stage modules (`ad_detector`, `ad_reviewer`, `chapters_generator`) call `config.get_stage_tunable` at request time so a Settings UI change takes effect on the next episode without restarting the worker.

## [2.2.12] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Truncated LLM responses now salvage usable ad verdicts instead of failing open (#221).** `extract_json_ads_array` already calls `_salvage_truncated_single_ad` as a final fallback when a model runs out of token budget mid-response, but the salvage helper required the body to start with `{`. Both the detector and the opt-in reviewer prompt for an array of ad verdicts, so truncation lands inside the first object with `[` at the head, and the salvage path was being skipped. The helper now strips a leading `[` before its `startswith('{')` guard, letting the existing regex recover `start`/`end`/`reason` from the partial body. Benefits both code paths (detector and reviewer) via the shared helper.

## [2.2.11] - 2026-05-13

### Changed

- `REVIEW_MAX_TOKENS` raised from 1024 to 4096 and made env-overridable via `REVIEW_MAX_TOKENS`, matching the `AD_DETECTION_MAX_TOKENS` default and override path. The single-ad LLM response cap is now consistent with the broader detection cap; smaller models with chatty JSON envelopes were occasionally getting truncated at 1024.

### Fixed

- **Zyn cascade cleanup extended to per-marker frozen data.** 2.2.10 cleaned up `ad_patterns.sponsor_id`, but the editor reads each ad's sponsor from `episode_details.ad_markers_json` where the value was frozen at detection time. Episodes detected during the 2.2.7-2.2.9 window kept showing `Zyn` after the 2.2.10 deploy. Added a one-shot startup migration that scans every episode's `ad_markers_json`, finds markers with `sponsor='Zyn'`, extracts the actual transcript text for the marker's `[start, end]` window via `extract_text_in_range`, and clears `sponsor` (plus strips `Zyn` from the `reason` string) when the canonical brand is not present in the window. Idempotent and conservative: only markers whose detected audio does NOT contain Zyn are touched.

## [2.2.10] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Sponsor name no longer falsely resolves to Zyn on unrelated ads.** The 2.2.7 Zyn seed added `Zin` and `Zinn` as aliases. The startup `extract_sponsors_for_patterns` backfill matched those aliases against every ad pattern's transcript and overwrote `sponsor_id` to the Zyn row whenever it found a word-boundary hit, including transcripts that mention Howard Zinn or unrelated brand mentions. The result was that every ad opened in the editor showed "Zyn" as the sponsor. Three changes:
  - Drop the `Zin` alias from the Zyn seed; keep `ZYN` and `Zinn`.
  - The pattern-level sponsor backfill now requires the canonical sponsor name (not just an alias) to appear as a whole word in the text before writing `sponsor_id`. Aliases on their own are no longer enough confidence for an automatic write.
  - One-shot startup migration clears `sponsor_id` on every pattern currently pointing at the Zyn row whose `text_template` does not contain `Zyn` as a whole word. Idempotent: only fires for the contaminated rows, only clears when the canonical brand is absent.

## [2.2.9] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Playback starts at the ad, not at episode origin.** When the user clicked Play on a review-mode editor for a mid-roll or post-roll ad, audio was starting at `0:00` because of a race between the `loadedmetadata` seed and the user's Play click. `togglePlay` now snaps the cursor to `adStart - 2` if the cursor is parked far before the visible window. The seed effect's stale `currentTime < 0.1` guard is removed (the togglePlay safety net handles the race) and `audioUrl` is added to the seed effect's deps so toggling Processed <-> Original re-seeds the cursor.

## [2.2.8] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- **Closing the new-ad modal no longer "leaves a second popup behind".** The 2.2.6 sync useEffect was overriding the user's Cancel: `handleClose` set `internalCreateMode = false`, the modal flipped to review for a frame, then the effect re-imposed `createMode = true` from the parent prop and flipped it back to create. The user perceived this as a stacked review modal appearing under the create form. `handleClose` now tracks whether create mode was entered via the in-modal `+ Add new ad` (returns to review) vs the page-header button (closes entirely). The sync useEffect is now one-way: it only flips into create mode on a fresh prop transition, never overrides an internal close.
- **Sponsor autocomplete dropdown now has an opaque background.** Swapped `bg-popover` (`--popover` was never defined in the theme, so it resolved to transparent) for `bg-card`, plus `z-20` and `shadow-lg` so the dropdown reads as a popover above the form fields.
- **Waveform colors follow the active theme.** Wavesurfer's `waveColor` and `progressColor` are now read from the `--muted-foreground` and `--primary` CSS variables at mount time, so switching themes (Slate, Dracula, Catppuccin, Nord, etc.) updates the waveform palette on next open.

## [2.2.7] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Real sponsor autocomplete in create mode.** New `SponsorInput` combobox component renders the dropdown inside the React tree so a suggestion click stays within the modal panel (the old `<datalist>` browser-native popup escaped the modal and dismissed the editor). Includes a `+ Add new: <typed>` option when no exact match.
- `Zyn` sponsor seed with `Zin` / `Zinn` aliases (Whisper mishears).

### Changed / Fixed

- **Manually-created ads now display sponsor + reason on the page row.** Backend synthesizes a `<sponsor>: manually added ad` reason when the user leaves Reason blank; frontend adds a sponsor chip alongside the time range and a `Manual` (amber) detection-stage badge.
- **Modal can no longer be dismissed accidentally.** Backdrop close switched to `onMouseDown` with an `e.target === e.currentTarget` guard, so only clicks on the bare backdrop area trigger close. In create mode, backdrop close is disabled entirely, so the user must use Cancel or X to dismiss a form they're filling out.
- **Diagnostic logs for reprocess.** Stage 2 (text pattern) now logs `considered N patterns, matched M`. Database init logs `Pattern catalog: ad_patterns active=N, known_sponsors active=M`. Lets us distinguish "Stage 2 had 0 patterns to consider" from "Stage 2 considered many but matched 0" from "Claude returned 0".

### PWA

- `skipWaiting: true` + `clientsClaim: true` on the Workbox config. New deploys take over open tabs on next page load instead of waiting for all tabs to close.

## [2.2.6] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- **Crash after `Save & Next` on a create-ad submission.** `getAdCorrection` at `EpisodeDetail.tsx:180` dereferenced `c.original_bounds.start` for every correction in the list. `'create'` corrections legitimately have `original_bounds=null` (no original bounds for a brand-new marker), so the first one to land after the new correction posted crashed the page with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'start')`. Added a null guard on the find predicate.
- **Transcript text now refreshes when the user moves a pin in create mode.** Dropped the "only when empty" guard on the `/transcript-span` auto-fill effect. The text template is meant to be derived from the current window, so the fetch now always overwrites the field; manual edits get clobbered when the user drags a pin (acceptable trade-off, see follow-up note in plan).
- **`+ Add new ad` from a review-mode modal no longer bleeds review state into the create form.** AdEditor now sets a `key` prop on `<AdReviewModal>` that changes on mode flip and on ad switching, forcing React to remount the modal so all `useState` hooks re-initialize from the `defaults` useMemo cleanly.

### Changed

- Window-times row in the modal header now reads `Window: 0:00.0 - 4:02.1` instead of two unlabeled numbers flanking the checkbox + Reset button.

## [2.2.5] - 2026-05-12

### Changed / Fixed

- **Editable selection timestamps.** The Selection readout was static text on 2.2.0-2.2.4 even though the original plan called for editable inputs. The green start time and red end time are now controlled inputs that accept `MM:SS[.s]`, `H:MM:SS[.s]`, or raw seconds. Commit on blur or Enter, revert on Escape, clamped to `[0, episode_duration]` with `start + 1s <= end`. Pin drag still updates them live.
- **Dropped the `+/-1m` window-extent buttons from the modal header.** They were a verbatim lift from PR #204 and the original 2.2.0 plan explicitly dropped them. The keyboard shortcuts `,` and `.` still expand the window; the pin handles still set the ad boundaries. The strip now shows only the window time labels, the `Play audio while dragging pin` checkbox, and the Reset button.
- **`+ Add new ad` from the page header now flips an already-open editor into create mode.** Re-added the `useEffect` that syncs the internal `createMode` state when the prop changes (was removed in 2.2.1 to satisfy `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`; the lint is wrong here, so the rule is disabled on that one line with a comment explaining why).
- **Modal backdrop now hides the page chrome.** Swapped `bg-black/50` for `bg-background/95 backdrop-blur-sm` so the underlying `Detected Ads` list no longer shows through when the editor is open.

## [2.2.4] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- **`Detected Ads (N)` header buttons no longer wrap on mobile.** `Edit Ads` and `+ Add new ad` are now icon-only on the default breakpoint (with `aria-label` + `title` for accessibility) and pick up their text labels at `sm:` and up. Tighter `px-2` + `gap-1.5` + `text-xs` keep everything on a single row even when the count goes into double digits.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- **Modal header truncated the title to `D.`** on narrow viewports. The `h2` had `flex-1 truncate` next to a flex-row of action chips, so when the chips occupied most of the width the title compressed to its first letter. The title is now `hidden sm:block` (the metadata row below already identifies the editor; the title is decorative on mobile), and the chrome no longer fights for space.
- **`+ Add new ad` button wrapped to a second row on mobile.** It is now icon-only on the default breakpoint (`+` plus screen-reader label) and gains the `Add new ad` text on `sm:` and up.
- **Bottom action bar overflowed.** Skip / Reject / Save buttons now show short labels on mobile (`Skip`, `Reject`, `Save`) and the full `& Next` suffix only on `sm:` and up, with tighter gaps + padding so all three fit on a 360px viewport.
- Reduced horizontal padding on the modal chrome (`px-4` mobile / `px-6` desktop) to give the waveform and action bar more usable width on phones.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- **`+ Add new ad` now also lives on the `Detected Ads` page header** next to `Edit Ads`, so users can jump straight into create mode without first opening review mode.
- **Modal header restructured.** Stage / Confidence / Pattern / Reason chips now sit on their own row below the title and the Processed/Original/Add-new/Close action chrome, which kept the chrome from wrapping awkwardly on narrow screens.
- **Action bar buttons are equal-width and same-height** (`flex-1 basis-0 h-9` on mobile, fixed min-width on desktop). The `Save & Next` label no longer wraps to three lines and tower over its siblings.
- **Renamed the primary action label** from `Save adjustment & next` to `Save & Next` (and `Save adjustment` to `Save` when there is no queue).

## [2.2.1] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- **`+ Add new ad` was hidden behind the editor modal.** On 2.2.0 the button only existed on the page chrome behind the wavesurfer modal, so once you opened the editor you had no way to reach create mode. Moved into the modal header alongside the close button.
- **Processed / Original audio toggle was hidden behind the modal.** Same root cause. Moved the toggle into the modal header. Original is forced (and the toggle hidden) when the editor is in create mode, since you cannot mark a new ad against already-cut audio.
- **Create mode now uses the same waveform editor.** The 2.2.0 create flow used a plain form with numeric start/end fields. 2.2.1 reuses `AdReviewModal` so the user can drag the start/end pins on the actual waveform, with the text template auto-populated from `/transcript-span` and editable inline.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Create-new-ad workflow.** Mark an ad on any episode the detector missed, directly from `EpisodeDetail`. Submits via the new `'create'` correction type on `POST /api/v1/episodes/<slug>/<episode_id>/corrections`. The new marker is inserted into `ad_markers_json` (sorted by start), a new `ad_patterns` row is created with `created_by='user'`, and a `pattern_corrections` row of type `'create'` is recorded for cross-episode learning.
- **Waveform-based ad editor.** Replaces the prior plain `<audio>` + nudge-button `AdEditor` with a wavesurfer.js v7 editor. Draggable green/red pin handles, orange playhead with 1x-20x zoom, transport bar (SkipBack / Rewind10s / Play / Forward10s / SkipForward / Stop), live INSIDE AD / OUTSIDE AD indicator, mouse-wheel zoom, keyboard hotkeys (Space / C / R / S / arrows). Mobile layout drops keyboard hotkey hints and uses touch-only controls.
- `GET /feeds/<slug>/episodes/<episode_id>/peaks?start=&end=&resolution_ms=` returns ffmpeg-derived waveform peaks for a window. Auto-coarsens the resolution for very long windows so the JSON payload stays under ~600 KB. Drives the new editor.
- `GET /feeds/<slug>/episodes/<episode_id>/transcript-span?start=&end=` returns the transcript text spanning a window. Used by create mode to auto-populate the new pattern's `text_template`.
- `Accept-Ranges: bytes` advertised on `serve_original_audio` so the wavesurfer player can seek without re-downloading.
- Manual badge + Origin filter (All / Auto / Manual) on `PatternsPage` for patterns where `created_by = 'user'`.

### Changed

- **Sponsor normalization via FK.** `ad_patterns.sponsor` (free-text column) replaced with `ad_patterns.sponsor_id INTEGER REFERENCES known_sponsors(id)`. `pattern_corrections.sponsor_id` added (same FK target). All sponsor writes across `pattern_service`, `text_pattern_matcher`, `database/maintenance`, `api/patterns`, and the `PUT /patterns/<id>` endpoint now flow through a single sanitization chokepoint (`src/sponsor_normalize.get_or_create_known_sponsor`). Read paths JOIN `known_sponsors` and alias `name AS sponsor` so consumers don't change.
- `pattern_corrections.correction_type` CHECK extended to include `'auto_promotion'` (latent bug; the auto-promotion writer at `pattern_service.py:708` was writing a value the constraint rejected) and `'create'`.

### Migration

- One-shot migration in `_run_schema_migrations` adds the new columns, deduplicates case-variant rows in `known_sponsors` (lowest id wins), snapshots the old `ad_patterns.sponsor` text into a backup table, backfills `sponsor_id`, verifies (`PRAGMA foreign_key_check` clean + row-count parity vs the snapshot), then drops the old text column and recreates `pattern_corrections` with the extended CHECK. Each step is idempotent. On verification failure, destructive steps abort and the new columns plus backup table remain in place so the user can re-run on the next restart.

## [2.1.9] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- **PWA still blank on iOS after 2.1.8**. The 2.1.8 router migration was correct, but 2.1.8 also shipped React error #527 ("two React instances, version mismatch") because Dependabot PR #210 bumped `react` 19.2.5 -> 19.2.6 without also bumping `react-dom`. The 2.1.8 bundle ended up with `react@19.2.6` + `react-dom@19.2.5`, which throws on app init. Fix bumps `react-dom` to `^19.2.6` so both packages move together. Verified the rebuilt 2.1.9 bundle contains only the `19.2.6` version string.

## [2.1.8] - 2026-05-11

### Security

- Bump `urllib3` 2.6.3 -> 2.7.0 to clear CVE-2026-44431 and CVE-2026-44432 (both HIGH). Pulled in as a transitive of `requests`. Pinned in `requirements.in` so future `pip-compile` runs don't drift back.

### Fixed

- **iOS PWA blank screen on 2.1.7**. The 2.1.7 bump of `react-router-dom` 6.30.3 -> 7.15.0 broke `<BrowserRouter basename="/ui">` initialization under iOS WKWebView. Desktop browsers rendered fine; the installed iOS PWA loaded the bundle but rendered an empty `<div id="root">`. Fix migrates `frontend/src/App.tsx` from the v6 `<BrowserRouter>` + `<Routes>` + `<Route>` shape to v7's `createBrowserRouter([...], { basename: "/ui" })` + `<RouterProvider>` data-router shape. All page hooks (`useNavigate`, `useParams`, `useLocation`, `useSearchParams`, `Outlet`, `Link`, `Navigate`) are unchanged between v6 and v7, so no call sites were touched.

### Changed

- Benchmark docs now disclose how the corpus transcripts were produced. `benchmarks/llm/README.md` has a new "Transcript source" section listing the faster-whisper `large-v3` config, the exact `model.transcribe()` parameters (`beam_size=5`, adaptive `batch_size`, `word_timestamps=True`, `vad_filter=True` with custom `vad_parameters`, forced `language="en"`, and the sponsor-vocabulary `initial_prompt`), and a sample of `SEED_SPONSORS`. `benchmarks/llm/data/README.md` has a short pointer paragraph at the top. The generated `results/report.md` now contains a "Transcript source" section between "Methodology" and "Run Metadata" with the full sponsor list (254 entries) pulled lazily from `src/utils/constants.SEED_SPONSORS` at report time.
- Full humanizer pass on `benchmarks/llm/README.md`, `benchmarks/llm/data/README.md`, `benchmarks/llm/CONTRIBUTING.md`, and prose strings in `benchmarks/llm/src/benchmark/report.py`. All ASCII pseudo-em-dashes (` -- `) replaced with sentence breaks, semicolons, or colons depending on context. No Unicode em/en-dashes, smart quotes, bullets, or ellipsis chars in any benchmark doc.

## [2.1.7] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- LLM parser strategy 4: salvage a single-ad dict from responses that ran out of token budget mid-output. Triggered after the existing four strategies fail on structurally invalid JSON (no closing brace, unclosed string). Regex-extracts the numeric fields (`start`, `end`, `confidence`, `*_time`, `*_seconds`) and partial string fields (`reason`, `sponsor`, `advertiser`, `end_text`, `description`), returning the dict only when both `start` and `end` were recovered. Observed on Microsoft phi-4 in the offline benchmark; production hits this when a model emits a verbose `reason` field and saturates `AD_DETECTION_MAX_TOKENS`. Extraction method label: `json_object_single_ad_truncated`.

### Changed

- Benchmark `max_tokens` is now config-driven via `[run].max_tokens` in `benchmark.toml`, defaulting to production's `AD_DETECTION_MAX_TOKENS` so the benchmark matches the live app's budget by default. Reasoning models that need more headroom can override locally without touching production config.
- Benchmark `schema_audit` now imports production's `STRUCTURAL_FIELDS` and `SPONSOR_PRIORITY_FIELDS` to stop flagging fields the live parser already accepts (`end_text`, `sponsor`, etc.) as `extra_keys`. Prior runs reported ~9,898 spurious violations on those two field names alone.
- Benchmark code-quality cleanup: removed local duplicates of `parse_timestamp` and `format_time` in favor of `utils.time`; replaced hand-rolled `_violations_dict` with `dataclasses.asdict`; converted derived `ModelStats` fields (`cost_per_tp`, `tokens_per_detected_ad`) to `@property`; precomputed per-model indexes in `_aggregate` and per-model call counts in `_render_failures`; cached `avg_f1` and `mean_f1_stdev` on `ModelStats`; tightened the HTTP-5xx error classifier to use `\b5\d{2}\b` instead of fragile substring matching; extracted `_length_bucket` and `_position_bucket` helpers from inline ternaries.

### Security

- **Accepted CVE (no fix available)**: CVE-2026-31431 in `linux-libc-dev` (HIGH). The package provides kernel ABI headers from the ubuntu 24.04 base; it is used only at build time and not loaded at runtime. There is no upstream patch as of release. Both `2.1.7` and `2.1.7-cpu` images carry the same finding; it goes away when ubuntu publishes the fixed kernel-headers package.

### Dependencies

- bump anthropic 0.97.0 -> 0.100.0
- bump cryptography 47.0.0 -> 48.0.0
- bump gunicorn 25.3.0 -> 26.0.0
- bump huggingface-hub 1.13.0 -> 1.14.0
- bump openai 2.33.0 -> 2.36.0
- bump @tanstack/react-query 5.100.5 -> 5.100.9 (frontend)
- bump react 19.2.5 -> 19.2.6 (frontend)
- bump react-router-dom 6.30.3 -> 7.15.0 (frontend; major upgrade, no API surface change needed in this app)
- bump tailwind-merge 3.5.0 -> 3.6.0 (frontend)
- bump vite-plugin-pwa 1.2.0 -> 1.3.0 (frontend dev)
- bump node 24-alpine -> 26-alpine (Dockerfile frontend builder, both GPU and CPU images)
- holding ubuntu 24.04 -> 26.04 (Dependabot PR #208) until nvidia/cuda ships a 26.04 base; the GPU image is pinned to ubuntu 24.04 through `nvidia/cuda:12.9.1-runtime-ubuntu24.04`, so taking it now would split the GPU and CPU base images across a major OS version.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- Reviewer "boundaries unchanged" tolerance dropped from 0.5s to 0.1s. The previous floor was hiding any sub-second corrections the LLM was proposing by rounding them to `confirmed`. With the tighter floor, genuine half-second boundary tweaks now surface as `adjust` verdicts in the audit log so the distribution is visible.
- Added an INFO-level log line for every non-zero LLM-proposed boundary shift, including ones that round to `confirmed`. Format: `Reviewer @ A-Bs proposed delta start=+X.XXs end=+Y.YYs (rounded to confirmed | applied as adjust)`. Lets us see whether the LLM is consistently echoing original boundaries or proposing shifts that the floor was masking.

## [2.1.5] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- Reviewer mutations were not persisting to `ad_markers_json` when pass 2 reviewer rejected all verification ads (`v_ads_for_ui` empty). The downstream save in `process_episode` was gated on `if v_ads_for_ui:`, so when pass 2 cleared the list, the pass 1 reviewer fields the user saw in logs (`Reviewer pass 1 verdicts: 4 confirmed, 0 adjusted, 2 rejected, ...`) never made it into the persisted ad markers. UI showed no per-segment reviewer indicators because the data wasn't there. `_run_ad_reviewer` now calls `storage.save_combined_ads` itself after applying verdicts so persistence is self-contained and not coupled to pass 2 outcomes.
- Settings -> Experiments -> Ad Reviewer: the Review model dropdown only listed the literal "Same as pass model" sentinel and offered no concrete model choices. `Settings.tsx` was never passing `modelOptions` to `ExperimentsSection`, so the prop fell back to its empty default. Now wires the same `models` query result that `AIModelsSection` consumes (mapped through `formatModelLabel` for display parity with the existing Detection / Verification / Chapters dropdowns).

## [2.1.3] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Reviewer stage in the global status bar. The pipeline now emits `pass1:reviewing` (75%) and `pass2:reviewing` (90%) status updates when the reviewer is actually running, so the user no longer sees the bar stuck on the previous stage during the ~1-2 minute reviewer block. Frontend `STAGE_LABELS` carries matching "Pass 1: Reviewing detections" / "Pass 2: Reviewing detections" labels.
- Per-segment reviewer verdict badges on the episode detail page. Every reviewer-touched ad now carries an explicit pill: green "Reviewer: confirmed", cyan "Reviewer: adjusted", amber "Reviewer: resurrected", red "Reviewer: rejected", or gray "Reviewer: skipped" (the LLM call failed and the original detection was kept). Tooltips surface `reviewer_reasoning` on hover when present. The bare "Source: Reviewer" tag in the rejected detections list is replaced by the verdict-specific badge.
- Pass 2 reviewer verdict summary log line. `_apply_pass2_reviewer` now emits the same `Reviewer pass 2 verdicts: X confirmed, Y adjusted, Z rejected, ...` summary that `_run_ad_reviewer` already emitted for pass 1.

### Changed

- The Ad Reviewer Stats card on the Stats page now renders whenever the `/stats/reviewer` query has loaded, not only when `totalReviews > 0`. When zero, the card displays a hint pointing the user to Settings, Experiments to enable the reviewer.

## [2.1.2] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- Reviewer was still failing parse on every LLM call after 2.1.1: production stats showed 16/16 reviews returned failure. Root cause was prompt architecture, not parsing. The reviewer asked for a flat single-object output (`{verdict, reasoning, confidence}`) with structured user-prompt fields (`DETECTED AD: Start: X, End: Y, Sponsor: Z`), which invited the LLM to invent its own schema (`detected_ads: [...]`, `ad_segment: {...}`, `is_ad: bool`, etc.) instead of emitting the requested verdict object. Pass 1 / pass 2 detection do not have this problem because they emit a JSON array of `{start, end, confidence, reason}` objects, which is a familiar extraction shape every LLM handles consistently.
- Reviewer now mirrors detection's prompt and parser. Output is a JSON array of ad segments, parsed by the same `extract_json_ads_array` helper detection uses. Empty array means reject; one element means keep, with verdict (confirmed / adjust / resurrect) derived from the boundary delta vs the original (within 0.5s tolerance is treated as confirmed; shifted within the cap is adjust; resurrection-pool returns map to resurrect or reject).
- Provider-neutral fix. Works on Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, OpenRouter, and Ollama backends since they all already emit array JSON for detection. No tool-call API used.
- The user prompt drops the labeled `DETECTED AD: Start: X, End: Y, Sponsor: Z` block that was inviting the LLM to mirror with structured analysis. Replaced with the same minimal `Podcast / Episode / description / Transcript` shape detection uses, with the candidate ad called out inline via `>>> CANDIDATE AD START >>>` markers in the transcript.
- Schema migration v2.1.2 refreshes default-flagged `review_prompt` and `resurrect_prompt` rows to the new array-output prompts. User-customized prompts are left alone (matches the existing v1.0.x prompt-refresh pattern).

### Removed

- `_VERDICT_NORMALIZATION` map, `_apply_adjust` helper, and the cross-pool verdict-coercion logic from `src/ad_reviewer.py`. The verdict label is now derived from the array shape, so synonyms / case variations / wrap-recovery are not needed.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed

- Ad reviewer was hitting the unparseable-response failure path on every LLM call in 2.1.0. Two root causes, both fixed:
  - `AdReviewer._extract_response_text` did not handle the case where `LLMClient.messages_create` returns an `LLMResponse` dataclass with `.content` already a string (rather than the Anthropic SDK's `[TextBlock]` list). It fell through to `str(response)`, which produced a Python repr containing literal `\n` escape sequences instead of real newlines, causing every downstream JSON parse to fail with "Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes: line 1 column 2 (char 1)". The helper now handles `content` as a string directly.
  - Even when text extraction worked, claude-sonnet-4-6 was wrapping verdicts in extra metadata fields (`podcast`, `episode`, `ads_reviewed: [...]`) despite the prompt asking for a flat object. The reviewer now walks the parsed value to find the first nested dict containing a `verdict` key (`utils.llm_response.find_first_dict_with_key`).
- `DEFAULT_REVIEW_PROMPT` and `DEFAULT_RESURRECT_PROMPT` tightened to forbid wrapper objects explicitly (Output exactly one flat JSON object ... must start with `{` and end with `}` ... do NOT include podcast, episode, sponsor, ads_reviewed, results, summary, or any other field). Default-flagged rows refresh on next start via the existing v1.0.x prompt-refresh migration pattern; user-customized rows are untouched.

### Added

- 9 unit tests covering: `find_first_dict_with_key` traversal (top-level, nested-in-array, deeply nested, no-match, non-dict roots), and the reviewer end-to-end with the LLMResponse-dataclass shape, with extra-top-level-fields, and with the `ads_reviewed` array wrap.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- Opt-in LLM ad reviewer (issue #197). New third LLM stage that runs after detection and validation but before audio cuts. Per detected ad it returns one of: `confirmed` (cut as-is), `adjust` (shift boundaries within a configurable cap, default 60 seconds), or `reject` (false positive). The reviewer also evaluates validator-rejected detections whose confidence sits within 20 percentage points of the user's `min_cut_confidence` slider and may resurrect them as real ads. Disabled by default. Lives behind a single toggle under a new "Experiments" section in Settings, with a dedicated Ad Reviewer subsection that exposes the toggle, model selector ("Same as pass model" by default), max boundary shift, and editable confirm/adjust/reject and resurrect/reject prompts with reset-to-default. New module `src/ad_reviewer.py`. New `ad_reviewer_log` audit table populated with one row per ad reviewed (verdict, original/adjusted boundaries, reasoning, confidence, model, latency, success). Per-ad reviewer fields persist inside `episodes.ad_markers_json` (`reviewer_verdict`, `reviewer_original_start`, `reviewer_original_end`, `reviewer_reasoning`, `reviewer_confidence`, `reviewer_model`, `source`). Failure handling is non-blocking: a per-ad LLM failure falls through with the ad unchanged, and a catastrophic stage failure returns the input ads unmodified.
- New `GET /api/v1/stats/reviewer` endpoint with optional `podcast_slug` and `episode_id` query params. Returns total reviews, per-verdict counts, pass 1 / pass 2 adjustment counts, average boundary shift in seconds, resurrection count, and failure count. Surfaced in the Stats page as a new "Ad Reviewer Stats" card that hides when the reviewer has no logged data.
- Episode detail page renders the original timestamps on top and a "Reviewer: MM:SS - MM:SS" line beneath when the reviewer adjusted boundaries. Reviewer-rejected ads in the rejected detections list show a "Source: Reviewer" tag.

### Changed

- Prompt placeholder substitution replaces unconditional appending of the dynamic sponsor block. `_inject_dynamic_sponsors` is gone; system, verification, review, and resurrect prompts now use explicit `{sponsor_database}` placeholders that the runtime substitutes via `_render_prompt`. The review prompt also accepts `{max_boundary_shift_seconds}`. Removing a placeholder from a customized prompt is now a supported way to opt out of that injection (legacy behavior always appended). Boundary-cap enforcement remains in code regardless of prompt content.
- One-time migration on first start of this version backfills `{sponsor_database}` to user-customized `system_prompt` and `verification_prompt` rows so behavior matches what users had before. Idempotent via the `_review_prompt_migrated` settings flag. Default-flagged rows are untouched (the seed/refresh path manages those).
- `get_static_system_prompt()` (used by the offline benchmark) now uses placeholder substitution against the seed sponsor list rather than appending. Output is identical to the previous concat for a non-empty list.
- Extracted `_call_llm_for_window` from `src/ad_detector.py` to a free function `call_llm_for_window` in `src/utils/llm_call.py` with a parameterized `max_tokens` argument. The detector keeps the method as a thin wrapper. The reviewer reuses the same retry/backoff/auth-error semantics with a smaller token cap. Existing tests that patched the helper at `ad_detector.*` were updated to patch `utils.llm_call.*`.
- Extracted `_find_json_array_candidates`, `extract_json_ads_array`, and the JSON parsing strategies from `src/ad_detector.py` to `src/utils/llm_response.py`. Added `extract_json_object` for the reviewer's single-object responses. Backward-compatible re-exports keep existing imports working.

### Schema

- New `ad_reviewer_log` table (created on fresh installs via SCHEMA_SQL and on existing installs via `_create_new_tables_only`). Indexed on `episode_id` and `podcast_id`.
- Five new settings keys: `enable_ad_review` (bool, default false), `review_model` (string, default `same_as_pass`), `review_max_boundary_shift` (int seconds, default 60), `review_prompt`, `resurrect_prompt`. Plus the `_review_prompt_migrated` flag.

## [2.0.27] - 2026-05-08

### Fixed

- Settings page: editing one field and clicking Save no longer ships the entire form as a payload. The `updateMutation.mutationFn` in `frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx` now compares each state variable to its loaded value (`settings.X?.value`) and includes the field in the request body only when it changed. A short-circuit guard throws if `settings` is undefined at Save time, closing a sub-frame hydration window where the Save button could briefly render before the loaded values were applied to local state. The backend `if 'fieldName' in data:` guards in `update_ad_detection_settings()` already left omitted fields untouched in the DB; this PR adds two regression tests (`test_single_field_save_leaves_others_untouched`, `test_revert_to_defaults_is_accepted`) that lock that behaviour in. (#201)
- Slug length cap raised from 64 to 200 chars in `src/utils/validation.py`. The strict canonical `SLUG_RE` was rejecting auto-generated slugs from long podcast titles -- representative example: an "Artificial Intelligence (AI) News, ChatGPT, OpenAI..." podcast generates a 78-char slug. Such podcasts created successfully (read-side validators are permissive) but every WRITE endpoint that re-validates the slug -- including `POST /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episode_id}/corrections` -- silently returned 400 with no obvious user-facing signal. Path-traversal characters and the must-start-with-alphanumeric rule are unchanged. (#202)

## [2.0.26] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- Persist Whisper segments as JSON alongside the existing transcript columns. Two new TEXT columns on `episode_details`: `original_segments_json` (pre-cut, write-once via COALESCE) and `final_segments_json` (post-cut, overwritten on reprocess). Two paired endpoints expose them: `GET /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episode_id}/original-segments` and `.../final-segments`, each returning `{episodeId, segments: [{start, end, text}]}`. Older episodes return 404 until reprocessed.
- New `TranscriptGenerator.compute_final_segments(segments, ads_removed)` helper that applies the same filter+timestamp-adjust pass used internally by `generate_vtt` / `generate_text`, returning the post-cut segment list as plain dicts. Used by the pipeline to populate `final_segments_json`.

### Changed

- `src/main_app/processing.py` writes both segment columns at the natural points in the pipeline: `original_segments_json` immediately after Whisper transcription completes (alongside the existing `save_original_transcript` call), and `final_segments_json` inside `_generate_assets` once `compute_final_segments` has been computed for VTT generation.

### Why

- Unblocks the offline LLM benchmark (see `tmp/BENCHMARK_PLAN.md`): the benchmark needs original timestamped segments to feed `create_windows()` and to score IoU against ground truth. The existing `original-transcript` endpoint returns plain text; the `.vtt` endpoint serves the post-cut VTT with ads stripped. Persisting segments as JSON gives the benchmark a hermetic capture surface that matches what production saw at detection time, without re-running Whisper.

## [2.0.25] - 2026-05-06

### Changed

- Pre-work for an offline LLM benchmark that imports MinusPod modules directly. All changes are behavior-preserving for production:
  - Lifted `_extract_json_ads_array` and `_parse_ads_from_response` from `AdDetector` instance methods to module-level functions in `src/ad_detector.py` (`extract_json_ads_array`, `parse_ads_from_response`). The 3 in-tree call sites are updated; no external callers existed. `parse_ads_from_response` gains an optional `sponsor_service` keyword arg (defaults to `None`) so the benchmark can call it without an `AdDetector` instance.
  - Lifted the per-window prompt assembly to a module-level `format_window_prompt(...)` function. Both first-pass detection and verification-pass loops now call it instead of duplicating the assembly inline.
  - Added a module-level `get_static_system_prompt()` that returns `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` + the static `SEED_SPONSORS` list -- a deterministic, source-controlled prompt for the benchmark. `AdDetector.get_system_prompt()` (the production instance method that loads stored prompts and merges DB-derived sponsors) is unchanged. The two functions live side-by-side; production never calls the module-level one.
  - Moved `SEED_SPONSORS` and `SEED_NORMALIZATIONS` from `src/sponsor_service.py` into `src/utils/constants.py`. Re-exported from `sponsor_service` so existing imports (incl. `tests/unit/test_sponsor_seed_idempotent.py`) keep working without modification.
  - Renamed `_parse_vtt_to_segments` -> `parse_vtt_to_segments` in `src/api/episodes.py` (single in-tree caller updated). The benchmark imports it directly to feed transcripts through the same parser production uses.
  - Added `benchmarks/` to `.dockerignore` so the offline benchmark corpus, raw LLM responses, and reports never land in the production image.

### Tuned

- `AD_DETECTION_MAX_TOKENS` default raised from 2000 to 4096. The 2000-token ceiling was tight for verbose-but-correct LLM responses (multi-sponsor transcripts with detailed `reason` fields could truncate mid-JSON, surfacing as parse failures rather than truncation). 4096 doubles headroom while still bounding cost. **Cost note:** operators using the default will see higher max output tokens per detection call -- typical responses are well under 2000 already, so practical token spend is unchanged for short responses but larger for verbose ones. Operators with a custom `AD_DETECTION_MAX_TOKENS` env override are unaffected.

## [2.0.24] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- Pattern auto-creation from user corrections (`POST /api/v1/episodes/{slug}/{episode_id}/corrections` with `correction_type=confirm` or `boundary_adjustment`) stored the numeric `podcasts.id` in `ad_patterns.podcast_id`, while every other creation path (`learn_from_detections`, verification-miss auto-create) and the detection-side query (`get_ad_patterns(podcast_id=slug)`) use the slug. Patterns created this way were scoped to a value the matcher never queries with, so they were silently orphaned -- never retrieved during detection on subsequent episodes. `src/api/patterns.py` now stores the slug at both call sites, matching the `ap.podcast_id = p.slug` join the rest of the schema assumes (see `src/database/patterns.py:17`). Existing orphaned rows can be repaired by rewriting `ad_patterns.podcast_id` from numeric ids to the corresponding `podcasts.slug`.

## [2.0.23] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- The verification (second) pass now honors per-episode "not an ad" corrections (issue #183). Previously the pass-1 detector and validator already excluded user-rejected regions, but the verification pass constructed its `AdValidator` without `false_positive_corrections`, so the second-pass LLM rediscovered rejected segments on the cut audio and re-cut them. The reporter (Welcome to Night Vale, in-universe Big Rico's Pizza ad-read) saw the cut survive every reprocess. Pass 2 now translates each rejection from original-time to processed-audio coordinates using the pass-1 cut map and feeds them to the verification validator, which auto-rejects any verification ad that overlaps a user-flagged region by 50% or more.
- Stage-3 (Claude) post-processing in pass 1 now applies the same-episode false-positive region check that stages 1 and 2 already do. Defense-in-depth: the validator already protects pass-1 audio output, but the rejected segment used to still appear in `rejectedAdMarkers` for the editor whenever the cross-episode text-similarity check missed.

## [2.0.22] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Frontend ESLint flat config (`frontend/eslint.config.js`) plus `Lint (eslint)` step in the CI frontend job. Previously `npm run lint` was opt-in and unwired; now it runs on every PR. Rules in force: `@eslint/js` recommended, `typescript-eslint` recommended, and `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` recommended (which surfaces React 19 violations like `set-state-in-effect`, `static-components`, `refs` writes during render, and `exhaustive-deps`).

### Fixed

- React 19 hook violations across 12 frontend files surfaced by the new lint config. No user-visible behavior change; refactors are mechanical (during-render compare instead of useEffect+setState for prop-derived state, hoist nested components out of parents, sync ref-to-prop writes inside an effect, fill in missing `useCallback` / `useEffect` dependencies). Files touched: `AdEditor.tsx`, `CollapsibleSection.tsx`, `GlobalStatusBar.tsx`, `LanguageCombobox.tsx`, `Layout.tsx`, `AuthContext.tsx`, `AddFeed.tsx`, `EpisodeDetail.tsx`, `HistoryPage.tsx`, `PatternsPage.tsx`, `Settings.tsx`, `settings/PodcastIndexSection.tsx`, `settings/ProcessingQueueSection.tsx`.

### Changed

- Dependency bumps via dependabot:
  - `openai` 2.32.0 -> 2.33.0 (#191)
  - `huggingface-hub` 1.12.0 -> 1.13.0 (#189)
  - `lucide-react` 1.11.0 -> 1.14.0 (#190)
  - `swagger-ui-dist` 5.32.4 -> 5.32.5 (#187)
  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` 8.59.0 -> 8.59.1 (#188)
  - `@typescript-eslint/parser` 8.59.0 -> 8.59.1 (#185)
  - `eslint` 8.57.1 -> 10.3.0 (#186)
- New devDependencies in `frontend/package.json` to back the lint config: `@eslint/js`, `typescript-eslint`, `globals`.

## [2.0.21] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Cached RSS keeps stale enclosure URLs after `BASE_URL` changes (issue #193). The module-level `RSSParser` captured `BASE_URL` once at gunicorn boot, and the rendered RSS was cached on disk for 15 minutes, so an operator who set or corrected `BASE_URL` after first feed render would keep serving `http://localhost:8000/episodes/...` enclosures until the next staleness cycle. `RSSParser` now re-resolves `BASE_URL` at every URL-construction site (no longer mutates shared singleton state), and `serve_rss` sniffs the cached XML's enclosure prefix and forces a refresh on `BASE_URL` mismatch.

### Added

- `Dockerfile.cpu` and `docker-compose.cpu.yml` -- CPU-only variant for hosts without an NVIDIA GPU (issue #184). Drops the CUDA runtime base layer (~3.3 GB) and the bundled `nvidia-*` wheels (~2.8 GB) by installing the CPU torch wheels from `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu`. Final image lands around 3 GB versus ~16 GB for the GPU image. Published to Docker Hub as `ttlequals0/minuspod:2.0.21-cpu` and the floating `:cpu` tag. Pull with `docker compose -f docker-compose.cpu.yml up -d`. The `:latest` tag still points at the GPU image; CPU users should track `:cpu` or a versioned `-cpu` tag. CPU transcription is slow -- for non-trivial feeds, set `WHISPER_BACKEND=openai-api` and point at Groq, OpenAI, or a self-hosted whisper.cpp server.

### Changed

- `docker-compose.cpu.yml` now pulls `ttlequals0/minuspod:cpu` from Docker Hub by default. The previous `build:` directive is left commented in place. Users who relied on the local build behavior need to uncomment the `build:` block (one-line edit) and pass `--build` to `docker compose up`.

### Removed

- `docker-compose.openrouter.yml` -- superseded by `docker-compose.cpu.yml` (which delivers the same no-GPU path with a 3 GB image instead of the 16 GB GPU image the openrouter compose was pulling). Switch to OpenRouter on either main or CPU compose by setting `LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env`.

## [2.0.20] - 2026-05-02

Adds a Global Defaults group to the settings page (under "AI & Processing") that controls auto-process, max episodes per served feed, and "only expose processed episodes" as site-wide defaults. The two existing per-feed knobs that previously hardcoded their fallbacks now resolve through these globals; the `only_expose_processed_episodes` per-feed column becomes tri-state (per-feed override -> global default), matching how `auto_process_override` already worked.

### Added

- Settings: two new keys in the settings table -- `max_feed_episodes` (int, default 300) and `only_expose_processed_default` (bool, default false). Seeded via `_seed_default_settings()`. Existing `auto_process_enabled` is now grouped with them in the UI.
- `src/database/podcasts.py`: `get_max_episodes_for_podcast(slug, podcast=None)` and `is_only_expose_processed_for_podcast(slug, podcast=None)` resolvers (per-feed value when set, else global, else hard fallback). Mirror the `is_auto_process_enabled_for_podcast` shape.
- `src/api/__init__.py`: `_serialize_nullable_bool` / `_deserialize_nullable_bool` for tri-state INTEGER columns where None means "use the matching global default."
- `frontend/src/pages/settings/GlobalDefaultsSection.tsx`: new section component matching the project's CollapsibleSection + custom toggle div + number input patterns.
- API: `GET /api/v1/settings` and `PUT /api/v1/settings/ad-detection` accept `maxFeedEpisodes` and `onlyExposeProcessedDefault`.
- OpenAPI: `Settings` schema and POST/PATCH `/feeds` request bodies updated.

### Changed

- `podcasts.only_expose_processed_episodes` schema: `INTEGER DEFAULT 0` -> plain nullable `INTEGER`. Idempotent migration runs the 4-step ALTER chain (add v2 column, copy values, drop old, rename) only when the existing column has a default. Existing per-feed values: `1` is preserved (explicit override-on); `0` becomes `NULL` (resolves to the global default, which seeds as off, so no behavior change).
- `frontend/src/pages/AddFeed.tsx` + `FeedDetail.tsx`: per-feed control becomes a tri-state select (Global Default / Enabled / Disabled), matching the existing `autoProcessOverride` pattern.
- `src/main_app/feeds.py` `refresh_rss_feed`: routes both `feed_cap` and `processed_only` through the new resolvers instead of inline `or 300` and `bool(...)`.
- `src/api/feeds.py`: `maxEpisodes` and `onlyExposeProcessedEpisodes` in feed responses now return null when the per-feed value is not set (was: false / 300). Frontend types updated to `boolean | null` and `number | null`.
- `Settings` page "Audio" section: removed the static "Audio Analysis" subsection (no controls, just descriptive text -- the section already documented behavior elsewhere).
- `frontend/src/pages/settings/AdDetectionSection.tsx`: auto-process toggle moved out (now in Global Defaults). Section now hosts only the minimum-confidence slider.

## [2.0.19] - 2026-05-02

Add a per-feed advanced toggle ([#181](https://github.com/ttlequals0/MinusPod/issues/181)) that hides upstream episodes whose database status is not `processed` from the served RSS feed. Default OFF (no behavior change). Auto-downloading podcast apps (e.g. AntennaPod) currently see new episodes immediately and request the rewritten audio URL while the episode is still in `discovered` / `processing` / `permanently_failed`, which surfaces a 503 as a download error rather than a transparent retry. With this toggle ON, the feed only exposes an episode once it has actually been processed.

### Added

- `src/database/schema.py`: new `podcasts.only_expose_processed_episodes INTEGER DEFAULT 0` column (idempotent ALTER TABLE migration; existing feeds default to OFF).
- `src/rss_parser.py`: `RSSParser.modify_feed` accepts `processed_only` and `processed_episode_ids` parameters; entries whose `episode_id` is not in the allow-list are skipped before URL rewrite. `rss_parser` stays DB-free (caller supplies the allow-list).
- `src/main_app/feeds.py` `refresh_rss_feed`: reads the new column off the loaded podcast row, calls `db.get_episode_statuses_for_podcast(slug)` once when the flag is ON, and passes the `'processed'`-only allow-list through to `modify_feed`.
- `src/api/feeds.py`: `onlyExposeProcessedEpisodes` accepted on `POST /feeds` and `PATCH /feeds/{slug}`, surfaced on `GET /feeds`, `GET /feeds/{slug}`, and the PATCH response. Field changes on PATCH trigger an immediate `refresh_rss_feed` so the served RSS reflects the new value without waiting for the 15-minute cache.
- `frontend/src/api/types.ts`, `frontend/src/api/feeds.ts`: `onlyExposeProcessedEpisodes` on the `Feed` interface, `addFeed()` signature, and `UpdateFeedPayload`.
- `frontend/src/pages/AddFeed.tsx`: checkbox in the existing "Advanced options" `<details>` block, piped through to `addFeed(...)`.
- `frontend/src/pages/FeedDetail.tsx`: checkbox row alongside the existing per-feed settings, calls `updateFeed(...)` on change.
- `tests/unit/test_rss_parser_processed_only.py`: parametrized cases covering default OFF (regression guard), ON with a populated allow-list, ON with an empty allow-list (channel metadata preserved, zero items).

## [2.0.18] - 2026-04-29

Fix [#179](https://github.com/ttlequals0/MinusPod/issues/179): non-English podcasts had nearly every segment flagged as an ad. The "Pre-detect non-English segments as automatic ads (DAI in other languages)" heuristic in `src/transcriber.py` looks at non-ASCII character ratio and Spanish-specific keywords to flag segments. It was designed to catch foreign-language ads inserted into English podcasts (Dynamic Ad Insertion targeting Spanish-speaking audiences) but had no awareness of the configured `whisper_language` setting, so it false-positived entire foreign-language episodes.

The detector now runs only when we are confident the audio is English: configured `whisper_language='en'`, or `'auto'` mode where Whisper detected an English variant. For any explicit non-English language (`'es'`, `'pt-br'`, etc.) and for `'auto'` where Whisper detected non-English, the detector is skipped and the per-segment `is_foreign_language` flag is never set; downstream `_detect_foreign_language_ads` in `src/ad_detector.py` becomes a no-op without any change because it only acts on flagged segments.

No settings UI change. Existing English podcasts behave identically. The decision is logged once per transcription so it's visible in production.

### Fixed

- `src/transcriber.py`: new `Transcriber._should_detect_foreign_language()` static helper gates the detector on `transcribe_language` plus Whisper's `info.language`. Single one-time decision before the per-segment loop, applied via `is_foreign = should_detect_foreign and self._detect_non_english_segment(...)` at the existing call site.

### Added

- 15 parametrized tests in `tests/unit/test_transcriber_foreign_language_gating.py` covering the configured-English / auto-mode / configured-non-English matrix. 822 total tests pass (was 807).

## [2.0.17] - 2026-04-26

Frontend build-tooling rollup. Replaces dependabot PRs #170 (vite 8), #171 (tailwindcss 4), and #172 (typescript 6) which each failed CI on their own because they depend on each other. No runtime behavior change; build artifacts are equivalent (CSS 51.84 kB, JS bundle within 200 bytes of prior size).

### Changed

- ``frontend/package.json``: vite ``^6.4.2`` -> ``^8.0.10``, ``@vitejs/plugin-react`` ``^4.2.1`` -> ``^6.0.1`` (only line that supports vite 8 peer), tailwindcss ``^3.4.1`` -> ``^4.2.4``, typescript ``^5.3.3`` -> ``^6.0.3``, esbuild override ``>=0.25.0`` -> ``>=0.27.0`` (vite 8 requires esbuild ^0.27 || ^0.28). Added ``@tailwindcss/vite`` ``^4.2.4``. Removed ``autoprefixer`` and ``postcss`` (handled internally by ``@tailwindcss/vite``).
- ``frontend/vite.config.ts``: wired ``@tailwindcss/vite`` plugin before ``VitePWA`` so workbox precaches the v4-emitted CSS.
- ``frontend/src/index.css``: replaced ``@tailwind base/components/utilities`` with ``@import "tailwindcss"`` + ``@config "../tailwind.config.js"`` to keep the existing JS-based theme (``extend.colors``, ``borderRadius``, ``keyframes``, ``animation``) without rewriting it as v4 CSS-first config.
- ``frontend/tsconfig.json``: dropped deprecated ``baseUrl`` (TS6 warns; ``moduleResolution: bundler`` resolves ``paths`` without it).
- ``frontend/postcss.config.js``: deleted; @tailwindcss/vite handles transforms.
- 18 component files: ``flex-shrink-0`` -> ``shrink-0`` and ``break-words`` -> ``wrap-break-word`` per the official ``@tailwindcss/upgrade`` codemod. No visual change; v4 keeps both names but the codemod canonicalizes to the shorter form.

### Added

- ``frontend/.npmrc``: ``legacy-peer-deps=true``. ``vite-plugin-pwa@1.2.0`` (latest) caps its vite peer at ``^7``; vite 8 support has not been published. The flag scopes the install to npm's pre-7 resolver behavior so the install completes. Comment in the file flags this as removable once vite-plugin-pwa publishes vite 8 support.
- ``react-is`` ``^19.2.5`` to ``dependencies``. recharts declares ``react-is`` as a peer; rolldown (vite 8's bundler) is stricter than rollup about transitive resolution and fails the build at ``recharts/es6/util/ReactUtils.js`` if ``react-is`` isn't a direct dep.

### Closed (without merge)

- #170 vite 6 -> 8 (rolled into this PR)
- #171 tailwindcss 3 -> 4 (rolled into this PR)
- #172 typescript 5 -> 6 (rolled into this PR)

## [2.0.16] - 2026-04-25

Hot-fix on top of 2.0.15. The 2.0.15 fix removed the per-instance ``self._llm_client`` cache in ``AdDetector`` / ``ChaptersGenerator`` and routed every call through ``get_llm_client()``. That closed half the staleness bug. The other half is the **per-worker** cache in ``llm_client._cached_client``: gunicorn runs two workers, each with its own module-level cache, and only the worker that handles the settings PUT runs ``force_new`` to rebuild. The sibling worker keeps its old client and silently routes requests to the previous provider/base_url.

Direct evidence: at 2026-04-25 23:27:09 the user switched provider from ``openrouter`` to ``openai-compatible`` (``http://192.168.5.35/v1``). Worker A handled the PUT and rebuilt. The reprocess at 23:27:27 landed in Worker B, whose cache was last set at 23:26:46 (during the parallel UI poll) to ``openrouter``. At 23:29:51 all six ad-detection windows POST'd ``claude-sonnet-4-6`` to ``https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`` (visible in Loki), got 400 ``"is not a valid model ID"`` from OpenRouter, and the run failed.

### Fixed

- ``src/llm_client.py`` ``get_llm_client()`` now compares the cached client's config to the current effective config on every call and rebuilds when they differ. New ``_current_config_key()`` returns a stable string of the effective ``provider`` plus ``base_url`` (and applies the same Ollama ``/v1`` normalization ``_build_client`` applies). The ``_cached_client_config_key`` module global is set when the cache is populated and compared on each subsequent call. Cost: one ``get_effective_provider()`` plus one ``get_effective_base_url()`` per call -- both go through the existing 5s settings cache, so the steady-state hot path is two ``dict`` lookups under the existing ``_provider_cache_lock``. After at most ``_PROVIDER_CACHE_TTL`` seconds, every worker sees the new config and rebuilds without IPC. The settings handler still calls ``force_new=True`` for an immediate rebuild on the worker that handled the PUT.

### Added

- 4 tests in ``tests/unit/test_llm_client_openrouter.py`` ``TestGetLlmClientConfigInvalidation``: same config returns cached, provider change forces rebuild, base_url change forces rebuild, Anthropic config key is stable. Plus the existing 2.0.15 tests still pass (807 total, was 803).

## [2.0.15] - 2026-04-25

Two related fixes to LLM-client behavior that surfaced together while running an OpenRouter-free-model test on 2.0.14: a stale per-instance client cache that ignored provider switches, and a rate-limit retry loop that ignored the server's `Retry-After` hint and then tripped the circuit breaker on throttling.

### Fixed

- `src/ad_detector.py` and `src/chapters_generator.py` no longer cache the LLM client instance on `self._llm_client`. Both classes now expose `_llm_client` as a `@property` that reads through `get_llm_client()` on every access. Direct evidence: on 2026-04-25 the user switched provider via `/settings` from openai-compatible to openrouter, the global cached client correctly rebuilt to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`, but `AdDetector` (a module-level singleton in `src/main_app/__init__.py`) still held the old instance whose `base_url` was `http://192.168.5.35:8001/v1`. Three POSTs at 22:28-22:29 routed `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` to the local endpoint and got 502s. The property closes the per-instance cache layer entirely; only the global, lock-protected, settings-API-invalidated cache in `llm_client._cached_client` remains. A test-only setter writes to a `_llm_client_override` slot so existing tests that mock `det._llm_client = MagicMock()` keep working.
- `src/llm_client.py` now skips `circuit_breaker.record_failure()` when `is_rate_limit_error(e)` is true in both `AnthropicClient.messages_create` and `OpenAICompatibleClient.messages_create`. Throttling is the provider asking us to slow down, not a provider outage; counting it would open the breaker after 5 free-tier 429s and block the entire provider for 60s. Non-rate-limit errors (5xx, network, timeout) still record failure as before.
- `src/ad_detector._call_llm_for_window` honors the `Retry-After` header on 429s. New helper `extract_retry_after()` in `src/llm_client.py` reads the header off `error.response.headers` (both Anthropic and OpenAI SDK shapes), routed through `parse_retry_after()` in the new `src/utils/rate_limit.py` (delta-seconds + RFC 7231 HTTP-date, clamped to 300s). Server hint gets an additive 0-2s jitter so concurrent workers don't all wake on the same tick. When the header is absent, the rate-limit branch uses `calculate_backoff(attempt, base_delay=30.0, max_delay=120.0)` -- closer to the prior 60s minute-window behavior than the default 2s exponential backoff would have been. The previous unconditional `delay = 60.0` is gone.

### Added

- `src/utils/rate_limit.py` with `parse_retry_after(value, *, max_seconds=300.0)` -- the only HTTP `Retry-After` parser in the repo. Accepts delta-seconds and HTTP-date forms.
- `src/llm_client.extract_retry_after(error, *, max_seconds=300.0)` for pulling the header off provider exceptions.
- `tests/unit/test_rate_limit_helpers.py` (14 cases) and 10 new cases in `tests/unit/test_llm_client_openrouter.py` covering: header presence/absence, lowercase header name, max-seconds clamp, circuit breaker stays closed across 5 consecutive 429s on both client classes, non-429 errors still trip the breaker, and the AdDetector property re-reads `get_llm_client()` on every access. 803 tests pass; was 779 + 24 new.

### Operational note

`src/utils/circuit_breaker.py` `CircuitBreaker.record_failure` docstring now codifies the contract: callers must not record_failure on 429 / rate-limit errors. The class-level usage example was updated to point at the contract. Any future caller wiring this breaker into another HTTP path (RSS fetcher, etc.) needs to apply the same skip if it's a provider-throttle path.

## [2.0.14] - 2026-04-25

Hot-fix on top of 2.0.13. The `seed_initial_data()` rewrite shipped in 2.0.13 ran on every Gunicorn worker at startup, and with two workers + 139 new SEED rows to insert per deploy the per-row INSERT batches raced on the SQLite write lock. The contention cascaded into `database is locked` errors on the `POST /api/v1/episodes/<slug>/<id>/reprocess` endpoint and the background RSS refresher within minutes of the deploy.

### Fixed

- `src/main_app/__init__.py` now calls `sponsor_service.seed_initial_data()` only inside the existing `if _try_become_background_leader():` block, alongside the other "leader only to avoid SQLite contention" tasks (RSS refresh thread, queue processor thread, initial RSS refresh). Non-leader workers skip the seed entirely; their `SponsorService` instances lazy-load via `_refresh_cache_if_needed()` once the leader has populated the DB. The seed is still idempotent and still propagates new `SEED_SPONSORS` entries on next restart, just from one worker instead of N. Direct evidence: production saw `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` errors at 21:06-21:09 UTC on 2026-04-25 from the dual-worker race; rolling back to 2.0.12 cleared it. 2.0.13 has been retracted and `:latest` is back on 2.0.12 until 2.0.14 ships.

## [2.0.13] - 2026-04-25

Two complementary expansions to the sponsor recognition layer: ~36 more `SPONSOR_ALIASES` entries covering brands cross-referenced with a 2024-2026 podcast-advertiser registry, and a 139-row growth of `SponsorService.SEED_SPONSORS` with a one-time conversion of `seed_initial_data()` from "first-run only" to idempotent name-diff so future SEED additions auto-propagate to existing deployments.

### Improved

- `SPONSOR_ALIASES` (`src/utils/constants.py`) goes from 138 to 174 entries. New families: Affirm, Brex, Cloudflare, Eight Sleep, GitHub Copilot, LMNT, Mercury, Miro, Patreon, Perplexity, Pura, Retool, SeatGeek, Skyscanner, SoFi, StubHub, Substack, Vercel, Whoop. Each family includes the safe compound-split / hyphen / no-space variants. Risky homophones with common English words (`mirror` -> Miro, `cloud` -> Claude, `Sophie` -> SoFi, `brexit` -> Brex, `fuel` -> Huel, `thorn` -> Thorne) and AI model names (`gpt four`, `o three`, etc.) are intentionally excluded. The `Patreon` addition is direct-evidence-driven: episode `ff5a6158313e` ("It's a Thing 416") had a Patreon ad caught only by the verification pass on 2.0.12 with no canonical mapping; the new `pay tree on` and `patron` aliases close that gap.
- `KNOWN_SHORT_BRANDS` (`src/utils/constants.py`) gains `lmnt` and `acast`. Both are sub-6-character podcast-relevant single words that Gate B was rejecting.

### Added

- `SponsorService.seed_initial_data()` (`src/sponsor_service.py`) is now idempotent. It used to skip entirely on any non-empty `known_sponsors` table, meaning existing deployments never picked up new SEED entries. It now reads existing names, inserts only `SEED_SPONSORS` rows whose names aren't already present, and never touches existing rows. User-edited aliases via PUT `/sponsors/<id>` are preserved across deploys, and future expansions to the seed list propagate automatically on next container restart. Runs from the same call site (`src/main_app/__init__.py:624`) at app startup.
- `SEED_SPONSORS` grows from 115 to 254 entries, drawing from a curated podcast-advertiser registry (Magellan AI Q4 2025 + March 2026, Podchaser April 2026, SponsorUnited 2024). New brands span 13 categories: mental_health_wellness (Talkspace, Cerebral, Eight Sleep, WHOOP, Function Health, Inside Tracker, Levels, Ultrahuman, etc.), food_beverage_nutrition (Huel, OLIPOP, Poppi, Bloom Nutrition, etc.), tech_software_saas (Cloudflare, Vercel, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Substack, Patreon, Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), finance_fintech (Mercury, Brex, Affirm, Chime, Stripe, Coinbase, Plaid, Robinhood, etc.), travel_hospitality (Skyscanner, Hopper, Kayak, Booking.com, Vrbo), and more. De-duplicated against existing SEED names AND aliases (case- and punctuation-insensitive) so the idempotent re-seed adds exactly the missing rows.
- `tests/unit/test_sponsor_seed_idempotent.py`. 5 regression tests covering the new seed semantics: (a) empty DB seeds everything, (b) partial DB inserts only missing names, (c) user-edited aliases survive a re-seed, (d) deactivated rows are not reactivated, (e) running the seed twice in a row is a no-op. Sponsor seeding had zero test coverage before this; this is also the baseline.

### Operational note

A brand renamed via the API after this ships (e.g. `BetterHelp` to `Better Help`) would create a duplicate row on the next container restart because the old name comes back from the SEED list. Renames are uncommon. If it comes up, edit the matching `SEED_SPONSORS` entry in source at the same time.

## [2.0.12] - 2026-04-24

Coverage expansion of the sponsor-alias canonicalization layer introduced in 2.0.11, plus one additional Whisper hallucination filter. Pure data and regex changes; no logic changes.

### Improved

- `SPONSOR_ALIASES` (`src/utils/constants.py`) expanded from 2 entries to 138, sourced from a curated brand-name ASR error reference covering the top podcast advertisers. Compound-split variants (``hub spot``, ``hello fresh``, ``square space``, ``express vpn``, ``zip recruiter``, ``door dash``, ``draft kings``, ``fan duel``, ``head space``, ``master class``, etc.) and special-punctuation variants (``ag one``/``ag 1``/``ag1`` -> ``Athletic Greens``; ``one password``/``1 password`` -> ``1Password``; ``liquid iv``/``liquid i.v.`` -> ``Liquid IV``; ``hims and hers`` -> ``Hims & Hers``) now collapse onto canonical names before Gate A/B and pattern-existence lookup, so verification misses on common Whisper compound-splits no longer fragment patterns across multiple spellings. Canonical values mirror `SponsorService.SEED_SPONSORS` where a SEED entry exists for the brand (Athletic Greens, Butcher Box, Gametime, Honeylove, Liquid IV), so the LLM-output normalization path and the transcript-scanning path agree on a single name per brand. Entries grouped by sponsor family in source for readability. Risky homophones with common English words (``row`` -> ``Ro``, ``shipped`` -> ``Shipt``, ``loom`` -> ``Lume``) and ambiguous rebrand pairs (``factor 75`` -> ``Factor``) were intentionally excluded.
- `KNOWN_SHORT_BRANDS` (`src/utils/constants.py`) gains `noom`, `ipsy`, `lume` so single-word sponsors under 6 chars from real podcast advertisers pass Gate B and become eligible for pattern creation.
- `HALLUCINATION_PATTERNS` (`src/transcriber.py`) now drops `Subtitles by the Amara.org community`, a documented Whisper subtitle-data hallucination in the same class as the existing ``Thanks for watching``/``please subscribe``/``[silence]`` filters. Prevents a known subtitle-credit segment from leaking into ad detection on episodes where Whisper hallucinates from low-energy audio.

## [2.0.11] - 2026-04-23

Two follow-up fixes on 2.0.10, re-tagged under 2.0.11 rather than a new version.

### Fixed

- Reprocess detection in the new versioned-mp3 path used `processed_at` to decide first-process vs reprocess, but the reprocess state reset in `database.episodes` clears `processed_at` to NULL before `process_episode` runs. Result on 2.0.10: `previously_processed` was always False, `new_version` stayed at 0, and the reprocess output overwrote `{episode_id}.mp3` in place, defeating the point of the versioned filename. Observed live on DTNS 5253 reprocess: `processedUrl` came back without the `-v1` suffix. `src/main_app/processing.py` now derives the reprocess signal from `processed_version > 0` OR `reprocess_requested_at` being set. Both are preserved by the reprocess state reset (the version column because it's new, the timestamp because the reprocess endpoint stamps it on its way in). First-ever process still writes `{episode_id}.mp3`; second run and beyond write `{episode_id}-v{N}.mp3` as intended.
- DTNS 5253 reprocess also surfaced that Whisper transcribes the Xero sponsor read as "Zero" in some passes. The 2.0.10 auto-pattern-create path then declined because no matching pattern existed under "Zero" and the miss could not be learned. New `SPONSOR_ALIASES` map and `canonical_sponsor()` helper in `src/utils/constants.py` (maps ``zero``/``xerox`` -> ``Xero``); `src/ad_detector.py:learn_from_detections` and `src/pattern_service.py:record_verification_misses` normalize the detected sponsor before Gate A/B and the pattern-existence lookup. Effect: a verification miss reporting "Zero" now matches existing Xero patterns for a boost, and a new pattern (where the validator allows it) is stored under "Xero" instead of a parallel "Zero" entry.

## [2.0.10] - 2026-04-22

Three independent fixes bundled into one release: close the pattern-learning gaps that left verification-only sponsors unlearned and blocked short-name brands from ever becoming patterns; bump the processed mp3 filename on reprocess so podcast clients actually refetch instead of serving cached stale audio; and add LiteLLM's community pricing JSON as a fallback source so providers without a native OpenRouter or pricepertoken path stop recording `$0` token costs.

### Fixed

- `src/pattern_service.py:record_verification_misses` now auto-creates a podcast-scoped pattern for unmatched sponsors when transcript segments are available, instead of logging `manual pattern creation may be needed` and dropping the signal. `src/verification_pass.py` and `src/main_app/processing.py` thread the original-audio transcript segments through so the creation call uses the same `TextPatternMatcher.create_pattern_from_ad` guards (duration cap, denylist, contamination heuristics) as the pass-1 auto-learning path. Concrete problem observed on 2026-04-22: verification caught 13 sponsors across 8 episodes (Capital One, Kansas Crossing Casino, Blue Chew, Kane Footwear, Quaker, First Citizens, Carvana on MBW, Xero on Cordkillers, etc.) and created zero patterns for them; next week's episodes on the same podcasts would have paid for another Claude pass to find the same sponsors.
- `src/ad_detector.py:learn_from_detections` Gate B (short-single-word sponsor rejection) now treats a sponsor as known if it is in the sponsor registry, already has an active pattern anywhere in the DB, or appears in a curated `KNOWN_SHORT_BRANDS` seed (`src/utils/constants.py`). Previously the gate consulted only `sponsor_service`, so real brands like Xero, Venmo, Kayak, Meter, and Pura were rejected every run. The Pura case was the smoking gun: two existing active patterns on cordkillers and it's-a-thing (id 55, id 23, both Dec 2025) but a third creation on Flagrant today was still refused because the gate never looked at the pattern table. To keep the N-ads-per-episode loop cheap, active-pattern sponsor names are preloaded once per call via the new `Database.get_active_pattern_sponsors()` helper (`src/database/patterns.py`) instead of a per-ad SELECT.

### Added

- Reprocess now writes to a versioned audio path. New `processed_version INTEGER DEFAULT 0` column on the episodes table (`src/database/schema.py`, migrated via the existing `_run_schema_migrations` column-add path so no data is touched). `Storage.get_episode_path` takes an optional `version` kwarg (`src/storage.py`): first process stays at `{episode_id}.mp3`; each reprocess increments to `{episode_id}-v{N}.mp3`. Retention keeps only the current version; clients hitting the legacy unversioned URL are served through `serve_episode`, which reads `processed_version` from the DB and resolves to the current file, so the earlier copies can be deleted immediately on finalize. The retained `{episode_id}-original.mp3` is untouched. The public enclosure URL in the generated RSS and the `processedUrl` field in `/api/v1/feeds/<slug>/episodes/<id>` now include `-v{N}` when `processed_version > 0`, which triggers a refetch in PocketCasts and other clients that cache by URL. The serve route at `src/main_app/routes.py:serve_episode` accepts both URL shapes: legacy `/episodes/<slug>/<id>.mp3` continues to work and serves whatever the DB says is current, and `/episodes/<slug>/<id>-v<N>.mp3` serves that version directly with a fall-through to current if the requested version has been cleaned up. Filename logic is consolidated in the new `src/utils/episode_paths.py` helper so the three sites that build enclosure URLs or DB relative paths share one source of truth.
- LiteLLM's `model_prices_and_context_window.json` is now a fallback pricing source (`src/pricing_fetcher.py:fetch_litellm_pricing`). `fetch_pricing` calls it automatically when the primary (OpenRouter API or pricepertoken scraper) returns no rows or raises, and for `unknown` provider domains that previously logged `costs will record as $0`. Fallback filters by `litellm_provider` keyed on the active provider, skips entries without per-token costs (image gen, embeddings), and uses the same `safe_get` + `URLTrust.OPERATOR_CONFIGURED` posture as the existing fetchers.

### Tests

- New `tests/unit/test_verification_misses.py::TestRecordVerificationMissesAutoCreate` covers: auto-create on unknown sponsor when segments are passed; no auto-create when segments are absent; "validator rejected" declined-pattern log path; matched-sponsor path still boosts instead of creating.
- New `tests/unit/test_ad_detector_learn_from_detections.py::TestGateBShortSponsor` covers: unknown short sponsor still rejected; sponsor in registry passes; sponsor with existing active pattern passes; sponsor in `KNOWN_SHORT_BRANDS` passes; long names and multi-word names bypass Gate B entirely.
- New `tests/unit/test_versioned_mp3.py` covers: `get_episode_path` with `version=None/0/1/5`; `iter_episode_audio_paths` returns unversioned plus all versioned files; `cleanup_stale_audio_versions` retains current + previous and drops older; `_processed_url` and RSS enclosure URL both produce the `-v{N}` suffix when `processed_version > 0`.
- New `TestLiteLLMFallback` class in `tests/unit/test_pricing.py` covers: JSON parsing (skip `sample_spec`, skip entries missing per-token costs, skip unparseable), per-token to per-Mtok conversion, provider filter, fallback on empty primary, fallback on primary exception, unknown-domain fallback, and that a successful primary does not invoke LiteLLM.
- 772 tests pass, 4 skipped. Frontend TypeScript check clean.

### Operational

- Backward compatible on deploy. Existing `{episode_id}.mp3` files stay at version 0 via the column default. The first reprocess after upgrade writes `{episode_id}-v1.mp3`, updates the RSS URL, and leaves the unversioned file in place for one cycle so PocketCasts and other clients that haven't refetched the RSS can still resolve their cached URL. The second reprocess cleans up the unversioned file. Original audio retention at `{episode_id}-original.mp3` is unchanged.
- The `KNOWN_SHORT_BRANDS` seed list (`src/utils/constants.py`) is intentionally small and curated. Adding entries is a config change: bump the frozenset, deploy. A future patterns UI could expose an admin-maintained equivalent in the DB.

## [2.0.9] - 2026-04-22

Two unrelated fixes bundled into a single release: VAD gap detector false-positive cuts on conversational podcasts (regression in 2.0.7), and webhook URL validation rejecting self-hosted destinations on private IPs or non-default ports (issue #158). Production `:latest` was rolled back to 2.0.6 ahead of the VAD fix; deploying 2.0.9 restores VAD gap detection with the bugs fixed and unblocks local webhooks.

### Fixed

- VAD gap detector mid-gap branch (`src/vad_gap_detector.py`) now requires BOTH a signoff phrase before the gap AND a resume phrase after it (logical AND). Previously either side alone was enough, so common podcast filler ("thanks for tuning in", "welcome back") triggered cuts on its own. Marker reason text updated from "VAD gap with signoff/resume context" to "VAD gap with signoff and resume context" to reflect the new semantics. Head-gap and tail-gap branches are unchanged. Concrete regression: MacBreak Weekly 1021 (`5ef2df166c8e`) had 9 of 11 ad markers come from `vad_gap`, of which 8 carried `WARN: No ad signals in transcript` yet were ACCEPTed at adjusted confidence 0.80 and cut 9 to 44 seconds of show content each.
- `src/ad_validator.py:_verify_in_transcript` now forces vad_gap markers below the validator's `min_cut_confidence` threshold when neither sponsor names nor ad-signal patterns matched in range. The marker is sent to REVIEW instead of being auto-cut. Other detection stages (`claude`, `text_pattern`, `verification`, `fingerprint`) are unaffected. The clamp uses `min_cut_confidence - 0.01` rather than a fixed -0.15, so it stays correct if a user moves the aggressiveness slider. Defense-in-depth: even if the detector regresses, the validator stops unsupported cuts.
- Webhook URL validation now uses `validate_base_url` instead of the strict `validate_url`, matching the SSRF posture already used for the LLM and Whisper base URLs. Self-hosted destinations on private IPs or non-default ports (e.g. Home Assistant on `http://192.168.x.x:8123`) are accepted; cloud metadata IPs and bad schemes are still blocked. Closes #158. The webhook create/update guard in `src/api/settings.py:_validate_webhook_url` is the single validation point at write time; `safe_post(..., trust=URLTrust.OPERATOR_CONFIGURED)` revalidates at dispatch and on every redirect hop, so the redundant pre-check that used to live in `webhook_service._prepare_and_dispatch` was removed.

### Tests

- New `tests/unit/test_vad_gap_detector.py::TestMidGap` cases:
  - `test_mid_gap_signoff_only_does_not_emit`
  - `test_mid_gap_resume_only_does_not_emit`
- New `tests/unit/test_vad_gap_detector.py::TestMBW1021Regression` class with `test_one_sided_signoff_no_resume_skipped` and `test_one_sided_resume_no_signoff_skipped`.
- New `tests/unit/test_ad_validator.py::TestAdValidatorVadGapVerification` class with `test_vad_gap_with_no_signals_drops_below_cut_threshold`, `test_vad_gap_with_sponsor_in_range_keeps_confidence`, and `test_non_vad_gap_no_signals_not_penalized`.
- New `tests/unit/test_webhook_service.py::TestPrepareAndDispatchSigning::test_prepare_and_dispatch_allows_private_ip_per_operator_trust`. Existing `test_prepare_and_dispatch_ssrf_blocked` reworked to assert that `_prepare_and_dispatch` short-circuits on the `SSRFError` raised by `safe_post`'s tier check (rather than the now-removed pre-check).
- New `tests/unit/test_settings_validation.py::TestWebhookUrlValidation` class with `test_create_webhook_allows_private_ip_url`, `test_create_webhook_blocks_metadata_ip`, and `test_create_webhook_blocks_bad_scheme`.
- 741 tests pass, 4 skipped (no regressions in other suites).

### Operational

- Production `:latest` was re-pointed to 2.0.6 manifest digest `sha256:012d2f89a77ba02f49c5df5e557d644936308be4aa677e92b629e686ea669d41` while this fix was prepared. Deploying 2.0.9 supersedes that rollback.

## [2.0.8] - 2026-04-21

Dependency rollup. No application-behavior changes. Every Dependabot PR open after 2.0.7 merged is addressed here or explicitly deferred.

### Changed

- CI action versions: `actions/checkout@v4 -> @v6`, `actions/setup-node@v4 -> @v6`, `actions/cache@v4 -> @v5`. Closes #141, #143, #144.
- Frontend React 18 -> 19.2.5 (`react`, `react-dom`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`). Codebase audit found no breaking patterns; `@tanstack/react-query` v5 and `react-router-dom` 6.30 are React-19-compatible. Closes #146, #150.
- Frontend `swagger-ui-dist` 5.17 -> 5.32. Closes #147.
- Frontend `tailwind-merge` 2 -> 3.5. Cosmetic; repo has zero `twMerge` callsites (uses `clsx`). Closes #148.
- Frontend `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` and `@typescript-eslint/parser` 7 -> 8.59, `eslint` 8.56 -> 8.57. Plugin and parser versions now match; CI passes again. Closes #149.
- Frontend `lucide-react` 0.344 -> 1.8 (peer-dep bump; 0.x didn't support React 19).
- Backend `ctranslate2` 4.4.0 -> 4.7.1 (Python). Closes #151.
- Backend `gunicorn` 23.0.0 -> 25.3.0 (Python). `gthread` worker class and lifecycle hooks in `gunicorn.conf.py` unchanged. Closes #152.
- Backend `feedparser` 6.0.11 -> 6.0.12. Closes #154.
- Vite build target raised from default (`es2020`) to `es2022` so modern private-field syntax from the bumped React Query / React internals can be emitted.

### Fixed

- `requirements.in` now pins `backports.tarfile` explicitly. `jaraco.context 6.1.2` declares it as a conditional dependency for Python < 3.12. `pip-compile` run on a Python 3.12 host (typical local dev) silently omits the pin, and the container's Python 3.11 `pip install -r requirements.txt` then fails in `--require-hashes` mode with "In --require-hashes mode, all requirements must have their versions pinned with ==". The failure was masked by a `|| true` at the end of the `RUN pip install` chain in the Dockerfile, so the image built "successfully" with ctranslate2 / gunicorn / faster-whisper / etc silently missing. Pinning `backports.tarfile` unconditionally in `requirements.in` makes the lockfile portable across 3.11 and 3.12 compile hosts. Dockerfile `|| true` masking is out of scope for this PR (it's on the cache-cleanup step; the real fix is at the dependency source).

### Removed

- Dockerfile workaround that hand-extracted `libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8` from `nvidia-cudnn-cu12==8.9.7.29`. CTranslate2 made cuDNN optional in 4.6.3 (pure-CUDA Conv1d), so the bump to 4.7.1 lets us drop the side-channel install and the `/opt/cudnn8/lib` entry in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Image dropped from 16 GB to 14.2 GB.

### Ignored / deferred

- `#142` nvidia/cuda 12.6.3 -> 13.2.1. Needs coordinated bump with torch (cu13x wheel) and ctranslate2 CUDA-13 build. Closed, `@dependabot ignore this major version`.
- `#145` node 20-alpine -> 25-alpine. Jumps LTS. Track node:22-alpine (next LTS) in a follow-up PR. Closed, `@dependabot ignore this major version`.
- `#153` numpy 1.26.4 -> 2.4.4. `requirements.in` has the load-bearing pin `numpy<2.0` with the comment `numpy 2.x requires X86_V2; target server lacks them`. Closed, `@dependabot ignore this major version`.

## [2.0.7] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- VAD gap detector (`src/vad_gap_detector.py`) catches audio regions Whisper's VAD drops so they never reach the transcript: sped-up legal disclaimers at ad tails, distorted interstitials, long untranscribed silences adjacent to an ad. Runs after Claude + text-pattern + roll detection, before validation. Head-of-episode gaps (>= 3s) are always cut; mid-episode gaps either extend an adjacent existing ad in place or require signoff/resume context before a standalone cut emits; tail-of-episode gaps (>= 3s) are cut when no postroll already covers them. Motivated by a DTNS episode where the DIA ad's sped-up legal babble sat in the pre-transcript window and would otherwise leak into the processed output. Confidence 0.75 on emitted markers; `detection_stage='vad_gap'`.
- Four env vars for operators to tune or disable the detector: `VAD_GAP_DETECTION_ENABLED` (default `true`), `VAD_GAP_START_MIN_SECONDS` (default `3.0`), `VAD_GAP_MID_MIN_SECONDS` (default `8.0`), `VAD_GAP_TAIL_MIN_SECONDS` (default `3.0`). Each also available as a DB setting and via `PUT /api/v1/settings` for parity with other whisper knobs. Not surfaced in the UI; these are advanced knobs most operators will never touch.

### Changed
- `openapi.yaml` documents the four new `vadGap*` fields on `/settings` request and response schemas.

## [2.0.6] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- `WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` setting (env var, DB setting, and Settings > Transcription dropdown) with values `auto`, `float16`, `int8_float16`, `int8`, `float32`. Default `auto` resolves to `float16` on CUDA and `int8` on CPU, preserving prior behavior when unset. Reported and prototyped by @zuhaibzia in issue #139.
- Automatic compute-type fallback in `WhisperModelSingleton.get_instance`: when the resolved type is `float16` on CUDA and model init raises (Pascal GTX 10xx, Maxwell GTX 9xx, Jetson TX2; CTranslate2 does not support fp16 below compute capability 7.0), the server retries `int8_float16`, then `int8`, then `float32` and logs the final active type. Any other explicit choice that fails still raises so a bad value isn't masked.
- README "GPU Compute Type" subsection with a per-GPU recommendation table and links to the CTranslate2 quantization docs and NVIDIA's CUDA compute-capability list.

### Changed
- `openapi.yaml` now documents `whisperComputeType` on the `/settings/transcription` request and response schemas.
- Added `.dockerignore` so local dev artifacts and secret-bearing files (`cookies.txt`, `.env*`, `*.db`, `.venv`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `tmp/`, etc.) never enter the build context. The existing selective `COPY` statements in the Dockerfile already keep these out of the final image; this is defense-in-depth for future edits.

## [2.0.5] - 2026-04-20

### Changed
- Transient-failure auto-retry schedule extended from 3 attempts (5/15/45 min) to 5 attempts (5/15/30/60 min) before marking `permanently_failed`. Covers the common case where upstream CDNs (Acast's `sphinx` in particular) take 30-90 minutes to propagate a newly-published MP3 after the RSS `<item>` appears. Without the extra attempts, episodes like `daily-tech-news-show:407e3e5382c5` gave up at roughly 8 minutes of wall clock time and required manual reprocess; the new tail reaches ~1h50m. `MAX_EPISODE_RETRIES` bumped 3 -> 4 in `config.py`. Backoff ladder in `reset_failed_queue_items` updated to `5m / 15m / 30m / 60m`. Applies to both auto-process and client-requested reprocess paths.
- `reset_episode_status` (invoked by `POST /api/v1/feeds/<slug>/episodes/<id>/reprocess`) now zeroes `auto_process_queue.attempts` in addition to `episodes.retry_count`. Before this, a user clicking Reprocess on an episode that had hit attempt 4 would reset the episode row but leave the queue's attempt counter stale, causing the next auto-retry to wait 60 minutes instead of the 5-minute first-step delay. Both counters now reset together so a manual reprocess is a true clean slate.

## [2.0.4] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- `POST /api/v1/feeds` now retries the title-extraction RSS fetch once after a 500 ms gap before giving up. Some hosts (Buzzsprout in particular) 403 the first request from a fresh client but serve the retry successfully, which previously caused the auto-slug branch to fall through to a URL-path fallback and commit junk slugs like `1411126` for "Maintenance Phase". After the retry, title-based slugs succeed end-to-end in the same create request.
- When the title fetch still fails after the retry and the caller did not supply a `slug`, the endpoint now returns a `400` with "Could not fetch podcast title from RSS. Please provide a 'slug' in the request." The old URL-path fallback (which silently produced a numeric or otherwise misleading slug from paths like `rss.buzzsprout.com/1411126.rss`) is removed. Callers who want to control the slug explicitly can continue to pass `slug` in the request body; that path is unchanged.

## [2.0.3] - 2026-04-19

### Changed
- Lowered topic-detection LLM temperature from 0.3 to 0.1 (`TOPIC_DETECTION_TEMPERATURE` constant). Same transcript now yields the same boundaries across reruns; eliminates the run-to-run title and timestamp variance observed when comparing pipeline vs regenerate output. Title generation keeps temperature 0.3 since title wording benefits from minor variation.
- Episode-description handling: when the RSS description embeds `MM:SS` markers (any of `05:30 Title`, `[05:30] Title`, `(5:30) Title`), extract them deterministically with `_parse_description_anchors` and inject the resulting candidate-boundary list into the topic-detection prompt with an instruction to prefer them. When the description has no parseable timestamps, the previous behavior of pasting the full description as plain context is preserved. Restores curated show-note chapter quality without re-introducing the divergent multi-stage pipeline removed in 2.0.2.

## [2.0.2] - 2026-04-19

### Changed
- Pipeline and manual regenerate now produce the same chapters for the same episode. Both paths share a single `ChaptersGenerator.generate_chapters` that runs one full-transcript AI topic-boundary pass. The pipeline-only description-timestamp parsing, ad-gap seeding, per-segment splitting, and topic-matching stages have been removed; the RSS episode description is instead injected into the LLM prompt so the model can honor curated timestamp markers on its own. Eliminates an ~600-line divergence between the two code paths that caused the pipeline to return fewer chapters than a manual regenerate on the same episode.

### Removed
- Internal helpers no longer used: `parse_description_timestamps`, `detect_ad_gap_chapters`, `merge_chapters`, `split_long_segments`, `detect_topics_from_description`, `_match_topics_to_transcript`, `_get_transcript_summary`, `_reverse_adjust_timestamp`, `_html_to_text`, `format_chapters_json`, and the obsolete `generate_chapters_from_vtt` entry point.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- Chapter detection no longer truncates the transcript at 8,000 characters before sending it to the LLM. On long episodes (typically > 15 minutes) the model could only see the opening of the transcript, which caused manual chapter regeneration to return 1 or 2 chapters regardless of requested `num_splits`. Fix restores the intended number of boundaries for full-length episodes. Covers both the VTT regeneration path and the main-pipeline long-segment splitter.

### Security
- Redacted `userinfo` (embedded `user:password@`) from the debug log in `utils.url.validate_url` so credentials in configured outbound URLs cannot leak into container logs. Resolves CodeQL alert #42 (`py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data`, high).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-17 (security audit)

Coordinated security hardening pass across the auth surface, crypto, SSRF, path containment, artwork validation, rate limits, container privileges, and log hygiene. Several breaking changes; operators should read the Removed and Security sections before deploying. The full audit plan lives in `tmp/MinusPod_Audit_Remediation_Plan.md`.

### Added
- CI workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: pytest on Python 3.11 with cached torch CPU wheels, frontend `npm run build` (runs `tsc` and `vite build`), `pip-audit`, and `npm audit`. Runs on every push to `main` / `feature/**` and on pull requests to `main`. Image build stays local (manual via `build-and-push`), so no Docker job in CI.
- Scaffolding modules the rest of the audit migrates against:
  - `src/utils/validation.py` - strict and permissive slug / episode-id validators, plus `is_public_ip_for_lockout` covering CGNAT and the IPv6 equivalents.
  - `src/utils/safe_http.py` - trust-tier enum (`OPERATOR_CONFIGURED`, `FEED_CONTENT`), redirect-context enum, `ResponseTooLargeError`, `FetchResult`, `read_response_capped`, `safe_get`, `safe_post`.
  - `src/utils/subprocess_registry.py` - process registry with `tracked_popen` and `terminate_all` (SIGTERM -> SIGKILL escalation).
  - `src/utils/db_backup.py` - SQLite online-backup helper with tight file permissions.
  - `src/utils/secret_writes.py` - shared `set_or_clear_secret` used by both provider routes.
- `gunicorn.conf.py` mirrors the previous inline flags from `entrypoint.sh` so lifecycle hooks (`on_starting`, `post_fork`, `when_ready`) can be wired from a tracked config file.
- `secrets_crypto.migrate_plaintext_secrets` + `count_plaintext_secrets`: startup migration re-encrypts any legacy plaintext `*_api_key` row under the current DEK. Idempotent via the `enc:v1:` prefix; no-op when there is nothing to migrate. Mandatory pre-migration SQLite snapshot is written (PID+UUID in filename, mode `0o600`) before any writes; a failed backup aborts the migration so plaintext stays recoverable.
- `auth_failures` SQLite table and `AuthLockoutMixin` (`check_lockout`, `record_auth_failure`, `record_auth_success`, `cleanup_auth_failures`). Cleanup is invoked from `cleanup_service.run_all`.
- `GET /api/v1/health/live` liveness probe. Returns `{"status": "ok"}` with no side effects; safe for per-second polling.
- `GET /api/v1/system/status` now reports a `security` block with `cryptoReady: bool` and `plaintextSecretsCount: int`. The UI surfaces the plaintext-row count as an amber notice in the Provider Key Encryption card so an operator can tell at a glance whether any legacy rows remain.
- Opt-in Sentry error reporting via `SENTRY_DSN`. Flask integration, no performance tracing, `send_default_pii=False`. A `before_send` scrubber redacts `Authorization` / `Cookie` / `X-CSRF-Token` headers and URL-query keys whose names match `key` / `secret` / `token` / `password`.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` schedules weekly updates for pip, npm, docker, and github-actions with per-ecosystem labels.
- JSON log records now include `hostname`, `pid`, and (inside a Flask request context) `request_id`. `X-Request-ID` round-trips: inbound header (truncated to 128 chars) takes precedence, otherwise a 16-char UUID hex is generated and echoed back on the response.
- Openapi spec declares `components.securitySchemes.sessionCookie` plus a global `security: [{ sessionCookie: [] }]`. Public routes (`/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/status`, `/health`, `/health/live`) opt out with `security: []`. `/health/live` added to the spec.

### Changed
- `PUT /api/v1/settings/ad-detection` now encrypts at rest when setting `openrouterApiKey`, `whisperApiKey`, `podcastIndexApiKey`, or `podcastIndexApiSecret`. Previously those fields wrote plaintext to the `settings` table, bypassing the per-provider encryption path introduced in 1.2.0. Requests that touch these fields while `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` is unset return `409 provider_crypto_unavailable`.
- `db.set_secret` no longer double-wraps a value that already carries the envelope prefix. A UI round-trip that replays a masked ciphertext now stores the original envelope instead of a doubly-encrypted blob.
- `db.clear_secret` deletes the settings row instead of writing an empty string. Empty-string rows leak the fact that a secret was once configured for that key.
- `POST /api/v1/system/cleanup` is rate-limited to `1 per hour` and emits WARN audit logs on entry and completion, including source IP.
- `DELETE /api/v1/system/queue` is rate-limited to `6 per hour` and logs the cleared count at WARN.
- `GET /api/v1/history/export` is rate-limited to `5 per hour`.
- `POST /api/v1/feeds` rate limit tightened from `10/min` to `3/min`. Bulk OPML import retains its own dedicated limiter.
- `POST /api/v1/feeds` no longer debug-logs the request body. Missing-field warnings omit the received payload entirely.
- `POST /api/v1/patterns/import` validates the entire payload upfront and performs the write inside a single `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. Previously a replace-mode import could delete every existing pattern before erroring on a bad entry, leaving an empty table.
- `/api/v1/health` no longer instantiates `ProcessingQueue`. The endpoint still reports `{database, storage}` status with the same 200/503 semantics; existing Docker and Portainer health checks keep working.
- Password minimum length raised from 8 to 12 characters. Existing hashes still verify. `generate_password_hash` now explicitly pins `method='scrypt'`.
- `_check_ffmpeg_once` replaces per-`AudioProcessor` `ffmpeg -version` forks with an `lru_cache`-backed module-level check. One subprocess per worker lifetime.
- `_init_server_start_time` logs a WARN with traceback on the shared-status-file write failure instead of swallowing silently.
- Request bodies are capped at 10 MB via `app.config['MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH']`; oversized requests now return `413 Payload Too Large` before the handler runs.
- `Storage.get_podcast_dir`, `get_episode_path`, and `get_original_path` validate their inputs with `is_dangerous_slug` / `is_valid_episode_id` and verify the resolved path stays inside the storage root via `resolve() + relative_to()`. Traversal payloads raise `PathContainmentError` instead of silently resolving outside `/app/data/podcasts/`.
- Podcast artwork downloads treat the HTTP `Content-Type` header as advisory only. Accepted responses must declare a type in `{image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp}` (SVG excluded), come in under the configurable `MINUSPOD_MAX_ARTWORK_BYTES` cap (default 5 MB, floor 64 KB, ceiling 50 MB) via the streaming `read_response_capped` reader, and match a file-magic probe. Oversize responses are rejected outright instead of being saved partially.
- `GET /api/v1/feeds/<slug>/artwork` ships `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'`.
- `RSSParser.fetch_feed`, `RSSParser.fetch_feed_conditional`, `GET /api/v1/podcast-search`, `POST /api/v1/settings/providers/<name>/test`, `pricing_fetcher.fetch_openrouter_pricing`, `pricing_fetcher.fetch_pricepertoken_pricing`, `storage.download_artwork`, `Transcriber.download_audio`, `Transcriber.download_audio_with_resume`, `Transcriber.check_audio_availability`, `main_app._head_upstream` (upstream audio HEAD probe), `llm_client`'s Ollama `/api/tags` probe, `Transcriber.transcribe_via_api` (Whisper multipart POST), and `webhook_service._prepare_and_dispatch` all route through `utils.safe_http` (`safe_get` / `safe_post`) so every redirect hop is revalidated against the SSRF rules and HTTPS -> HTTP downgrades are blocked per-hop. Audio enclosures use the `FEED_CONTENT` trust tier (private IPs refused); operator-typed URLs use `OPERATOR_CONFIGURED` (private allowed, metadata + multicast + reserved refused).
- `validate_base_url` rejects literal cloud metadata IPs (`169.254.169.254`, `168.63.129.16`).
- `_validate_configured_base_urls` runs once at startup and ERROR-logs any operator-configured base URL (env vars and DB mirrors) that would fail SSRF validation. Startup is not aborted; fetch-time validators still refuse the URL on actual use.
- `/api/v1/status/stream` emits an application-level `event: auth-failed` message before closing when the session is missing or has lapsed. The frontend `GlobalStatusBar.tsx` handler listens for that event and redirects to `/ui/login`. Auth is revalidated on every keepalive tick.
- `ad_detector._find_json_array_candidates` replaces the nested-alternation regex that previously scanned Claude responses. Linear-time bracket-depth scanner that tracks JSON string context, closing a theoretical ReDoS window under adversarial payloads.
- `main_app.shared_state.permanently_failed_warned` is now a thread-safe `_BoundedSet(maxsize=10_000)` instead of an unbounded `set`.
- Container no longer runs application code as root. The Dockerfile creates a `minuspod` user (UID/GID 1000) and installs `gosu`; the entrypoint starts as root so it can `chown` the data volume on first boot, then drops privileges via `exec gosu minuspod gunicorn`. First-boot chown uses `find ! -user $APP_UID` and logs the migrated count. `APP_UID` / `APP_GID` env vars override; `docker run --user <N>` bypasses chown/drop.
- `cryptography` minimum bumped from 46.0.5 to 46.0.7.
- Startup backfill loops (`backfill_processing_history`, `backfill_patterns_from_corrections`, `deduplicate_patterns`, `extract_sponsors_for_patterns`) are now version-gated via a `system_settings` sentinel. They run on the first boot after a version bump and are skipped on every subsequent worker boot, avoiding a table scan on every gunicorn restart once the backfill has already run.
- `RSSParser.fetch_feed` checks the response `Content-Type` against an allowlist (`application/rss+xml`, `application/atom+xml`, `application/xml`, `text/xml`, `application/octet-stream`). Missing headers are accepted because many legacy RSS hosts send none; explicit HTML or binary types are rejected before feedparser is invoked.
- `refresh_rss_feed` now coalesces back-to-back calls for the same slug within a 30-second window. Stops the duplicate refresh observed in production when `serve_rss`'s on-demand refresh (triggered by a PocketCasts poll) races the 15-min background loop against the same feed. Both paths would do conditional-GETs 3-5 seconds apart, doubling upstream load for no benefit. `force=True` (finalize hook, manual reprocess, force-refresh API) bypasses the skip but still stamps the coalesce entry so subsequent non-force calls within the window are still suppressed.
- Dashboard loses the "Import OPML" button and its modal. Feature remains reachable from the Add Feed page; the Dashboard shortcut was redundant.
- SQLite connections now enable `PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL` and `PRAGMA wal_autocheckpoint = 1000` alongside the existing WAL-mode + 30-second busy timeout. NORMAL sync retains the WAL-mode durability contract (fsync on checkpoint and commit) without the fsync-every-write cost of FULL; the ad-detection pipeline already tolerates a lost last transaction on power failure. The `auto_vacuum` cleanup task additionally runs `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` before `VACUUM` so the WAL file is returned to zero bytes on the periodic sweep.
- `graceful_shutdown` now explicitly releases the background-leader `fcntl.flock` on signal, and calls `utils.subprocess_registry.terminate_all` to escalate SIGTERM -> SIGKILL on any tracked ffmpeg / whisper child. On Linux the close-on-exit semantics released the lock anyway; the explicit `LOCK_UN` is defensive for NFS and weirder filesystem layers.
- `/ui/*` static responses now ship per-class `Cache-Control` headers: `assets/*` (Vite-fingerprinted bundles) get `public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; `index.html` gets `no-cache, must-revalidate` so the next deploy is picked up immediately; other static files get `public, max-age=3600`.
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on `/episodes/<slug>/<episode_id>.vtt` and `/episodes/<slug>/<episode_id>/chapters.json` is now annotated in code as intentional (Podcasting 2.0 cross-origin fetch; no credentials) so future CORS-removal passes do not regress the spec-standard behavior.
- **Breaking:** `/docs` and `/openapi.yaml` moved under `/api/v1/`. The legacy root paths are no longer served -- operators must update any existing bookmarks or Portainer health checks to point at `/api/v1/docs` and `/api/v1/openapi.yaml`. The root paths return 404 via the slug preprocessor (both entries are in `RESERVED_SLUGS`). Swagger UI now loads `swagger-ui-dist` assets from `/ui/swagger/*` (bundled in the Docker image at build time) instead of the `unpkg.com` CDN. CSP and air-gapped deployments no longer require an external exception.
- `POST /api/v1/sponsors/normalizations` and `PUT /api/v1/sponsors/normalizations/<id>` accept a v2 body shape `{terms, canonical, category}`. The legacy `{pattern, replacement, category}` shape is still accepted for one release with a deprecation log; `GET` responses now return the v2 shape.
- `get_or_create_secret_key` acquires an exclusive `fcntl.flock` on `<data-dir>/.secret_key.lock` before reading or writing the persisted key. Two gunicorn workers booting simultaneously can no longer mint two different keys and invalidate each other's sessions. Data-dir resolution now honors `DATA_DIR`, `DATA_PATH`, and `MINUSPOD_DATA_DIR` for consistency with Storage / StatusService / ProcessingQueue.
- Blueprint-wide `url_value_preprocessor` rejects path-traversal slugs on every `/api/v1/*` route before the handler runs. Reads use the permissive `is_dangerous_slug`; writes use strict `is_valid_slug` and return 400. Public `/<slug>` RSS and `/episodes/<slug>/...` routes continue to rely on the storage-layer containment guard.
- `gunicorn.conf.py` now wires `on_starting` (master-only schema init before any worker is spawned, raises on failure) and `post_fork` (resets the `Database` singleton so each worker opens its own SQLite connection instead of inheriting the master's fd). `entrypoint.sh` invokes gunicorn with `-c /app/gunicorn.conf.py` instead of inline CLI flags so the hooks actually fire.
- `/api/v1/history/export` streams rows straight off the SQLite cursor via the new `iter_processing_history_rows` generator. Worker memory stays flat regardless of row count; the 5/hour rate limit now bounds cursor wall-time rather than peak heap.
- Removed the redundant per-`AdDetector` TTL cache. `llm_client._model_list_cache` already caches `list_models()` per provider with a 5-minute TTL, and `get_llm_client(force_new=True)` clears it on provider change.
- `/api/v1/system/backup` encrypts the SQLite snapshot with AES-GCM when `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` is set and serves it as `*.db.enc` (magic `MPBK01\x00`). Pass `?encrypted=false` to opt out. `scripts/decrypt_backup.py` accompanies the deploy for restores.
- Node base image pinned to `node:20-alpine@sha256:afdf98210b07b586eb71fa22ba2e432e058e4cd1304d31ed60888755b8c865fb`. Float-tag silent upgrades can no longer slip in at build time.
- `requirements.in` is the new direct-dependency source of truth; `requirements.txt` is the fully-pinned lockfile regenerated via `pip-compile --resolver=backtracking --output-file=requirements.txt requirements.in`. Transitive versions are now explicit.
- `docker-compose.yml` documents the non-root UID/GID 1000 contract with a commented-out `user: "1000:1000"` line so operators can override when their volume is owned by a different UID.
- `safe_url_for_log` is now applied at every outbound URL log site (`rss_parser`, `transcriber`, `pricing_fetcher`, `storage`, `llm_client`, `webhook_service`). URL paths and query strings no longer reach logs; scheme + host only.
- Processing finalize now closes any `pending` / `processing` / `failed` row in `auto_process_queue` for the just-completed episode. Fixes a double-trigger bug where a manual `POST /episodes/<id>/reprocess` finished but left the background-enqueued queue row pending; the refresh loop then re-fired the same episode seconds later (observed on `the-brilliant-idiots:52070c1f9bd2`, which ran through two full 20-minute processing cycles back-to-back). New index `idx_queue_podcast_episode(podcast_id, episode_id)` keeps the cleanup UPDATE off the full-scan path.
- HTTP and subprocess timeouts plus `max_redirects` are defined in `src/config.py` as tiered constants (`HTTP_TIMEOUT_PROBE/API/EXTERNAL/FETCH/WHISPER`, `HTTP_MAX_REDIRECTS_FEED/API`, `FFMPEG_CHUNK_TIMEOUT`, `FPCALC_TIMEOUT_FULL`, `SUBPROCESS_VERSION_PROBE`). Every outbound-HTTP and long-running subprocess call site now references a named constant so a future policy change (e.g. CDN redirect bump) is a one-line diff. `utils/safe_http.py` function defaults also reference the constants. `webhook_service.py` dropped its module-local `_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS` in favour of the shared `HTTP_TIMEOUT_PROBE`. The `audio_fingerprinter` chunked-extract path was unified at 60s (was 30s) so a slow-IO fingerprint no longer spuriously times out.
- `smoke/` directory adds local and remote smoke-test scripts for operators to exercise the 2.0 surface (CSRF, login lockout, SSRF, XXE, rate limits, artwork, RSS public paths, backup, patterns, log hygiene, shutdown, multi-worker).

### Removed
- **Breaking:** removed the legacy `OPENAI_API_KEY` -> `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` fallback in `get_effective_openai_api_key`. Deployments that previously relied on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` satisfying OpenAI-compatible provider requests must set `OPENAI_API_KEY` explicitly (or configure per-provider in Settings). A startup `WARN` fires when the old env-var shape is detected.
- **Breaking:** removed `flask-cors` and the `/api/*` CORS block. The Vite dev server proxies to the backend and production traffic is same-origin; the previous config had `allow_credentials` open to any of the listed origins. Any operator serving the frontend from a distinct origin must put it behind the same reverse proxy.
- Removed `assets/replace_old.mp3` (no code references it) and an unused `werkzeug.security` import in `api/__init__.py`.
- Removed the legacy `utils.http.post_with_retry` / `get_with_retry` / `_request_with_retry` / `is_retryable_status` helpers. Every outbound caller now routes through `utils.safe_http`; the log-scrubbing `safe_url_for_log` stays where it is.

### Security
- **Breaking:** `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` now defaults to `true`. Deployments on plain HTTP must set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=false` explicitly.
- **Breaking:** `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` now defaults to `Strict` (was `Lax`). The instance has no cross-site login flows; Strict closes the residual top-level-form CSRF vector. Override via `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` env var if an integration requires `Lax`.
- Double-submit CSRF protection on every mutating API request. Each response carries a `minuspod_csrf` cookie (non-HttpOnly, `SameSite=Strict`, `Secure` tracks the session cookie); every non-GET/HEAD/OPTIONS call to `/api/v1/*` must echo the cookie value in an `X-CSRF-Token` header. `secrets.compare_digest` gates the comparison. `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/status`, and safe methods are exempt. Frontend `apiRequest` injects the header automatically; OPML import (raw `fetch` for FormData) uses the same shared `csrfHeaders` helper.
- Per-IP login lockout on `POST /api/v1/auth/login`. After 5 failed attempts in a rolling 15-min window from the same public IP, further attempts return `429 Too many failed attempts` with a `Retry-After` header for the next 15 min. Counters live in SQLite so the decision is consistent across gunicorn workers. Private / loopback / link-local / multicast / reserved / RFC1918 / CGNAT / Tailscale-ULA / IPv6-discard addresses are excluded so operators behind shared NAT cannot be locked out by a neighbour.
- Reverse-proxy awareness: when `MINUSPOD_TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` is set to `N >= 1`, Werkzeug's `ProxyFix` middleware reads the client IP from the last `N` entries of `X-Forwarded-For`. Without ProxyFix a deployment behind Cloudflare (or cloudflared) would see every failed login as coming from the proxy and lockout would never fire. A container without the env var set logs a startup WARN.
- Baseline security headers on every response: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`. HTML responses also ship a Content Security Policy scoped to the UI's assets + Google Fonts. `Strict-Transport-Security` is opt-in via `MINUSPOD_ENABLE_HSTS=true`.
- `defusedxml.defuse_stdlib()` is called at the top of `main_app/__init__.py` before any XML-using module imports. Stdlib XML parsers (`xml.etree.ElementTree`, `xml.sax`, `xml.dom.minidom`, `xml.dom.pulldom`) now reject DTDs, entity bombs, and external references.
- New integration test suites exercise the full request path for several of the 2.0.0 fixes: `test_csrf.py` (double-submit), `test_login_lockout.py` (per-IP lockout + 429 + Retry-After + private-IP carve-out), `test_path_traversal.py` (traversal payloads via HTTP routes), and `test_security_headers.py` (health/live exemption, X-Request-ID round-trip, baseline security headers, CSP scope).
- Closed the remaining paths where raw exception strings reached API clients (flagged by CodeQL as `py/stack-trace-exposure`). `rotate_passphrase` now checks returned `ValueError` messages against a whitelist of known-safe strings before echoing them; unknown messages log server-side and the client receives a generic 400. Webhook template preview, webhook test, OPML import per-item failures, and bulk episode action errors replace `str(exc)` in the response body with a stable generic reason while keeping the detailed traceback in logs.

## [1.6.2] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **Configurable Whisper language** (issue #132). The transcription language was hardcoded to English, which silently dropped non-English ads on multilingual feeds. A new `whisper_language` setting (default `en`) is now plumbed through both the local (faster-whisper) and remote (OpenAI-compatible) backends. `auto` lets Whisper detect per request. Editable in Settings > Transcription via a searchable 97-language combobox (type a name or code; free-text fallback for rare codes) or by setting the `WHISPER_LANGUAGE` env var on a fresh install.
- `GET /api/v1/settings` now includes `whisperLanguage`; `PUT /api/v1/settings` accepts `whisperLanguage` with validation for ISO-639-1 shape or `auto`.

### Changed
- README: removed the dead `#stats` table-of-contents anchor. Added a short "Transcription language" subsection under Remote Whisper Transcription that links to the upstream supported-languages reference at https://whisper-api.com/docs/languages/. Added a `WHISPER_LANGUAGE` row to the environment variable table.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Reprocess/process pipeline crashed at the finalize stage with `NameError: name 'storage' is not defined`. `_finalize_episode` only destructured `db` from `_get_components()` and then called `storage.get_original_path(...)`; now it pulls `storage` too.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **Review mode in the Ad Editor** (issue #129). The ad editor now retains the pre-cut (original) audio alongside the processed output and exposes a "Processed / Original" toggle above the editor. Switching to Original plays the untouched download at the ad's original timestamps, so boundary adjustments can be verified by ear, no more fixing cuts blind from the transcript. The toggle disables itself with an explanatory tooltip for episodes that have no retained original (processed before this release, setting off, or expired by retention).
- New settings: `GET`/`PUT /api/v1/settings/audio` with `keepOriginalAudio` (default `true`). Exposed in the UI as a toggle under Storage & Retention. Roughly doubles per-episode audio storage when on.
- New endpoint: `GET /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episodeId}/original.mp3` streams the retained original; 404s when not available. Supports Range requests.
- Episode responses now include `hasOriginalAudio` and `originalAudioUrl`.

### Schema
- `episodes.original_file` nullable TEXT column (idempotent migration).
- `settings.keep_original_audio` seeded to `true` on fresh installs.

### Notes
- Existing episodes processed before v1.6.0 do not get originals retroactively. Reprocess an episode to capture one.
- Originals follow the same retention cleanup schedule as the processed file.

## [1.5.3] - 2026-04-14

### Fixed
- Closed CodeQL alert #5 `py/stack-trace-exposure`. Split the blueprint error handler in two: `HTTPException` subclasses return a structured JSON payload derived from `exc.code` / `exc.description`; any other exception is logged server-side via `logger.exception` and returns a generic `{"error": "Internal server error", "status": 500}`. The raw exception object no longer flows into the HTTP response.

### Documentation
- README: clarified processing/caching wording ("An episode is processed once..."), expanded HTTP 503 retry behavior to name the `Retry-After` values (30s / 60s), added `large-v3`, `turbo`, and `.en` variants to the `WHISPER_MODEL` row, added a note about LLM non-determinism above the Ollama recommendations, and softened the `qwen3.5:122b` claim to reflect it was author testing, not a broad benchmark.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- Stop spurious `Failed to list models for provider 'anthropic': No Anthropic API key provided` ERRORs on Settings page load. The Settings UI no longer fires the models query against the hardcoded default provider before `getSettings` returns; the query is gated on `settingsLoading`. Backend also demotes the "no key" preview failure from ERROR to INFO; other list_models failures still log ERROR.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Moved the processing-timeouts inputs into the Transcription settings section (was a separate section). Dropped the verbose help paragraph; the field labels and default annotations are enough.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- **Configurable processing timeouts** (issue #126). Soft and hard timeouts are now stored in the `settings` table and editable from the API (`GET`/`PUT /api/v1/settings/processing-timeouts`) and the UI (new "Processing Timeouts" section). Defaults match the previous hardcoded values (60 min soft, 120 min hard). Env vars `PROCESSING_SOFT_TIMEOUT` and `PROCESSING_HARD_TIMEOUT` seed the initial values on fresh installs. When either timeout fires, the log line suggests raising the matching setting.

### Fixed
- **Stale status after worker kill**. When a Gunicorn worker was killed mid-processing (deploy, SIGKILL, OOM), `processing_queue` detected the orphan in seconds via its flock probe but `status_service` kept reporting the dead job's `current_job` until the 60-minute soft timeout. `ProcessingQueue._clear_stale_state()` now also calls `StatusService.clear_if_matches(slug, episode_id)` on each clear path, so the UI updates immediately.
- **Graceful remote Whisper failures** (issue #125). Chunked transcription against an OpenAI-compatible Whisper API no longer aborts the whole episode when a single chunk fails. Up to ~20% of chunks may fail (minimum 1); the episode finishes with failed ranges logged as gaps. A pre-upload size guard refuses to POST files under 1 KB, cutting off the "empty audio / failed to decode" feedback loop. The remote Whisper retry count drops from 3 to 2 to avoid hammering a transiently broken server.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-13

### Documentation
- README humanization pass; noted Ollama Cloud free-tier caveats and which cloud models are actually routable.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-13

### Fixed
- After an LLM provider change, prune saved ad-detection / verification / chapters model IDs that the new provider's live `/v1/models` does not advertise. Previously an OpenRouter-style tag (e.g. `minimax-m2`, `kimi-k2:1t`) configured against one provider survived a switch to Ollama Cloud and every window silently failed with `not_found_error`: the server returned HTTP 200 with an error envelope, the parser treated the window as "no ads found," and an entire episode processed with zero detections. The prune uses the raw `client.list_models()` list (bypassing `_ensure_configured_models_present`, which would re-inject the stale IDs), and falls back to `reset_setting` so the new provider's default model takes over.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Ollama Cloud support. The Settings > LLM Provider section now exposes a key input when Ollama is selected, backed by the same encrypted store as the other providers (DB slot `ollama_api_key`, env fallback `OLLAMA_API_KEY`). Local Ollama still works with the field left blank. API: `/api/v1/settings/providers/ollama` joins the existing provider surface; the path-param enum now includes `ollama`.

### Changed
- `src/llm_client.py::_build_client` now threads the Ollama key (or `not-needed` fallback) into `OpenAICompatibleClient` for the Ollama branch. `get_api_key()` returns the Ollama key when the active provider is Ollama.

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-13

### Security
- Close CodeQL #33 (py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data). The helper log introduced in 1.3.1 took `rows: int` (a count), but CodeQL's inter-procedural taint tracking follows the return value of `secrets_crypto.rotate(db, old, new)` because the function is called with password-named arguments, so the `rotated` count inherits taint and any log sink reachable from it is flagged. Remove the success log entirely; the 200 response body already includes `{rotated: N}` for audit, and failure paths still log via `logger.exception`.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-13

### Security
- Close CodeQL #32 (py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data) in `src/api/providers.py`. The success log on the rotate-passphrase endpoint only emitted an integer row count, but CodeQL's taint analysis follows the `oldPassphrase` / `newPassphrase` body parameters through the enclosing function scope and flags any log sink it can reach. Moved the log call into a helper function with no password-named locals so the scanner has no taint path to follow.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Master passphrase rotation. New endpoint `POST /api/v1/settings/providers/rotate-passphrase` body `{oldPassphrase, newPassphrase}` decrypts every stored provider key under the current DEK, mints a fresh 16-byte salt, derives a new DEK from the new passphrase, and writes all new ciphertexts plus the new salt inside a single SQLite transaction. UI control lives under Settings > Security > Provider Key Encryption with confirm dialog and an explicit warning that `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` must be updated in the container environment to the new value before the next restart.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Rework provider key UI. The separate "Providers & API Keys" card introduced in 1.2.0 duplicated the existing LLM and Transcription sections. Key inputs now live inline inside `LLMProviderSection` (contextual to the selected provider) and `TranscriptionSection` (for the Whisper remote backend), with a three-state status chip (Stored encrypted / Using env fallback / Not set) and Save / Test / Clear affordances that only appear when relevant. When `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` is unset the input collapses to a one-line "Setup required" note in place, no separate banner.
- Remove dead plaintext-save state (`openrouterApiKey`, `whisperApiConfig.apiKey`, `apiKeyConfigured`) from the Settings page and its types; saves now always route through `/api/v1/settings/providers/<name>`.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-13

### Security
- Close CodeQL #30 and #31 (py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data) in `src/database/settings.py` and `src/llm_client.py`. The `key` parameter passed to the log calls was the setting name (e.g. `anthropic_api_key`), not the secret value, but CodeQL's taint analysis followed a parameter flowing out of a `get_secret`-shaped function into a log sink and flagged it. Drop the parameter from the format string; the stack trace on exceptions is enough to diagnose which setting failed.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added
- Provider & API key configuration via UI and API. New section under Settings lets an authenticated admin set Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, OpenRouter, and remote Whisper API keys (plus base URL and model where applicable), test the connection, and clear the stored value to fall back to the environment variable.
- New endpoints: `GET /api/v1/settings/providers`, `PUT /api/v1/settings/providers/<name>`, `DELETE /api/v1/settings/providers/<name>`, `POST /api/v1/settings/providers/<name>/test`. `GET` returns only configured/source booleans and never echoes key values.

### Security
- Provider API keys stored in the `settings` table are now encrypted with AES-256-GCM. The data-encryption key is derived via PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 (600k iterations) from `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` and a random 16-byte salt persisted as `provider_crypto_salt`. Ciphertext envelope `enc:v1:<b64 nonce>:<b64 ct+tag>` supports future rotation. Encryption is decoupled from admin auth, so password changes do not touch stored keys.
- Feature is locked when `MINUSPOD_MASTER_PASSPHRASE` is unset; the API returns `409 provider_crypto_unavailable` and the UI shows a "Setup required" banner. Env-var credentials continue to work in locked mode.
- Legacy plaintext rows for `openrouter_api_key` and `whisper_api_key` are read transparently and upgraded to ciphertext on the next save via the UI.

### Changed
- `get_effective_anthropic_api_key()` and `get_effective_openai_api_key()` added alongside the existing OpenRouter helper, giving all four providers the same DB-then-env resolution path.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-04-12

### Security
- Fully close CodeQL #5 (py/stack-trace-exposure). v1.1.2 moved exception text from the `message` arg to `details`, but the scanner still traced a flow because `error_response` unconditionally contained `data['details'] = details` for non-5xx calls; the `if status >= 500` early-return guard was invisible to CodeQL's taint analysis. Each 5xx caller now uses `logger.exception(...)` for server-side capture (full traceback included automatically) and passes no `details` at all, so there is no data flow from `str(e)` into the response.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-04-12

### Security
- Close CodeQL #5 (py/stack-trace-exposure): stop interpolating `str(e)` into the user-facing `message` arg of `error_response` for 5xx paths. Exception details now flow through `details=`, which `error_response` already strips from the client payload and logs server-side. Refactored 13 call sites across `api/episodes.py`, `api/system.py`, `api/feeds.py`, `api/patterns.py`.
- Close CodeQL #14 (py/full-ssrf) in `_head_upstream` by binding `validate_url()`'s return value to a new variable used in the subsequent `requests.head()` call, so CodeQL recognizes the sanitized flow.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-12

### Changed
- Episode Detail UI now shows validator-adjusted confidence alongside raw confidence when they differ ("80% raw / 75% adjusted"). Clarifies why an 80%-confidence detection can end up in the "Rejected Detections / kept in audio" section: the validator docked the score below the cut threshold.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-12

### Security
- Harden SSRF protection on upstream audio HEAD proxy (`_head_upstream` in `src/main_app/routes.py`); validate URLs via existing `utils.url.validate_url`
- Block XML external entity expansion on OPML import by switching to `defusedxml.ElementTree` (`src/api/feeds.py`)
- Fix path traversal and reflected XSS in `serve_ui` static file route (resolve + containment check, escape path in 404 body)
- Replace `tempfile.mktemp` with `tempfile.mkstemp` in `transcriber.preprocess_audio` (insecure temp file)
- Cap input length and bound regex quantifiers in `ad_detector` JSON array scan and `sponsor_service` domain extractor to prevent ReDoS
- Stop logging HTTP response bodies and tokens in URL query strings (`utils.http`, `transcriber`, `api.settings` webhook log) via new `safe_url_for_log` helper
- Strip `details` from 5xx JSON responses so exception text and stack traces no longer reach clients (`api.error_response`)
- Annotate PodcastIndex SHA-1 signature site with `# nosec` (upstream API contract; not a security-sensitive hash)
- Frontend: replace incomplete single-pass HTML stripping with `DOMParser`-based `stripHtml` helper in `EpisodeList` and `EpisodeDetail`

### Dependencies
- Roll up Dependabot PRs #116 picomatch, #117 minimatch, #118 flatted, #119 lodash, #120 vite (superseded by direct `npm audit fix` on this branch)
- Close Dependabot alerts #1 esbuild, #2 @remix-run/router, #6 rollup, #9 #10 minimatch, #11 #21 serialize-javascript, #13 flatted, #16 #17 picomatch, #22 #23 lodash, #24 vite
- Add `defusedxml>=0.7.1` to `requirements.txt`

## [1.0.100] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **Verification pass 413 on long episodes (>~30min)**: Verification re-transcription now uses `transcribe_chunked()` instead of single-shot `transcribe()`, matching the first pass. Episodes over the Whisper API's 25MB limit no longer silently report "clean" after a 413 -- they're chunked into ~10min segments and transcribed normally. Fixes #114.

## [1.0.99] - 2026-04-12

### Fixed
- **LM Studio / OpenAI-compatible endpoint json_object rejection**: Endpoints that don't support `response_format: {"type": "json_object"}` (e.g. LM Studio) now detected at startup via a lightweight probe. When unsupported, JSON output instructions are injected into the system prompt instead. Result cached in DB across restarts, cleared on provider/URL change. Fixes #111.

## [1.0.98] - 2026-04-10

### Changed
- **Fuzzy timestamp field matching**: Replaced hardcoded field name list with pattern-based matching for LLM response timestamps. Any key containing "start"/"end" that isn't a known text field (e.g. start_note, endorser) is now accepted as a timestamp. Eliminates the need to add new field names every time the LLM invents a variant.

## [1.0.97] - 2026-04-10

### Fixed
- **LLM timestamp field name parsing**: Added `ad_start`/`ad_end` and `timestamp_start`/`timestamp_end` to accepted field name list. LLM sometimes returns these variants instead of `start_time`/`end_time`, causing ads to be silently discarded. Discovered via rejection logging added in v1.0.95.
- **Memory logging TypeError**: `get_available_memory_gb()` returns a tuple `(value, description)`, not a plain float. Fixed tuple unpacking that crashed all episode processing in v1.0.96.

## [1.0.96] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **Stats page 500 error**: SQL JOINs used `e.podcast_slug` which doesn't exist on the `episodes` table. Fixed to `e.podcast_id`. Also fixed pre-existing same bug in `get_latest_completed_processing` (webhook duration data).
- **Stats page chart theming**: Charts now use CSS custom properties from the active theme instead of hardcoded hex colors. Theme changes apply automatically via MutationObserver.

## [1.0.95] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- **History page filter broken**: Podcast name filter did nothing due to parameter mismatch -- frontend sent `podcast_slug`, backend read `podcast`. Fixed in both history list and export endpoints.
- **Ad detection confidence threshold**: Lowered `medium`/`moderate` confidence mapping from 0.80 to 0.75. The previous value exactly equaled `MIN_CUT_CONFIDENCE`, causing borderline ads to be silently dropped. Added warning logs for discarded ad candidates (missing timestamps, invalid ranges) to aid debugging.
- **Ad editor seek-to-marker plays from start**: Jumping to an ad marker from the episode detail page reset audio to the ad start instead of the clicked timestamp. Fixed competing useEffect race condition with a ref-based guard.
- **Feed 404s logged as ERROR**: Bot/crawler requests for non-existent feeds (e.g. security-weekly, lex-fridman) logged as ERROR. Now logged as WARNING since these are expected for unknown feeds.

### Added
- **LLM auth failure webhook**: New `Auth Failure` webhook event fires when LLM provider returns 401/403, with 5-minute dedup to prevent spam. Integrates with existing webhook infrastructure (HMAC signatures, enabled/events filtering).
- **Memory monitoring**: Logs available GPU/system memory at episode processing start and end. Runs `gc.collect()` + `clear_gpu_memory()` after each episode to prevent fragmentation.
- **Stats page**: New `/stats` page with dashboard metrics (avg/min/max time saved, ads removed, cost, processing time, episode length), charts for top podcasts by ads and episodes processed by day of week, and a full podcast stats table. Filter by podcast. Three new API endpoints: `GET /stats/dashboard`, `GET /stats/by-day`, `GET /stats/by-podcast`.

## [1.0.94] - 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Pattern corrections use wrong transcript (Issue #105)**: Confirming, rejecting, or adjusting ad detections extracted text from the post-cut transcript (ads already removed), causing pattern learning to capture podcast content instead of actual ad text. All 4 correction code paths now use the original (pre-cut) transcript with a fallback for episodes processed before v1.0.51.

## [1.0.93] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **String confidence fallback**: LLM responses with string confidence values ("high", "medium", "low") are now mapped to numeric floats instead of being silently dropped. Mapping is configurable via `CONFIDENCE_STRING_MAP` in config.py. Also handles percentage strings like "95%". Values align with existing confidence thresholds (medium=0.80 matches MIN_CUT_CONFIDENCE).

## [1.0.92] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **LLM returning non-numeric timestamps/confidence**: Added explicit type instructions to both detection and verification prompts -- "start", "end", and "confidence" fields must be numeric floats, never strings like "high", "low", or "95%". Includes sample values in the schema line for clarity.

## [1.0.91] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Verification miss NoneType crash**: `PatternService.record_verification_misses` crashed with `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'lower'` when a pattern had `sponsor: None`. Used `or ''` fallback instead of `.get()` default which doesn't cover explicit `None` values.

## [1.0.90] - 2026-04-06

### Fixed
- **Episode multiselect broken (Issue #102)**: Individual episode checkboxes did not toggle because the wrapper div used `preventDefault()` which blocked the label from toggling its input. Changed to `stopPropagation()` to prevent navigation while allowing checkbox behavior.
- **Verification miss recording failure**: `verification_pass.py` called `record_verification_misses()` on `SponsorService` which does not have that method. Fixed to use `PatternService` where the method actually lives.
- **Pricing fetcher warning spam for private IPs**: Private IP addresses (RFC 1918 ranges like 192.168.x.x) used as transcription endpoints were not recognized as local providers, triggering a warning log every 15 minutes. Added private IP detection to treat them as free/local.

### Added
- **Copy feedback on mobile**: All copy-feed-URL buttons (dashboard cards, list items, feed detail page) now show a checkmark icon with "Copied!" text for 2 seconds after tapping, providing clear visual confirmation that the URL was copied.

## [1.0.89] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- **Circuit breaker for external services**: LLM API and RSS feed fetching now use a circuit breaker that short-circuits after 5 consecutive failures for 60 seconds, preventing cascading failures when external services are down.
- **Docker health check**: Added HEALTHCHECK to Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml so Docker can detect and auto-restart unhealthy containers.
- **Docker log rotation**: All docker-compose services now use json-file logging with 50MB max size and 3 file rotation to prevent unbounded log growth.
- **Frontend API retry logic**: API client retries 5xx and network errors with exponential backoff (1s, 3s). 4xx errors are not retried.
- **LLM response truncation warning**: Logs a warning when LLM response is truncated due to hitting max_tokens, making it easier to diagnose detection issues.
- **Verification false negative logging**: When the verification pass finds missed ads, each missed ad is now logged with sponsor, timestamps, and confidence. Missed ads are fed back to the pattern service to boost matching patterns.
- **Configurable LLM max_tokens**: Ad detection max_tokens is now configurable via `AD_DETECTION_MAX_TOKENS` env var (default 2000).
- **New tests**: Added circuit breaker, feed refresh, verification miss, LLM truncation, and transcript fixture validation tests with real data from live instance (47 new tests, 512 total).

### Fixed
- **N+1 query in feed refresh**: Auto-process loop was making 2 DB queries per episode (up to 600 for a 300-episode feed). Now bulk-loads episode statuses in a single query and checks in-memory.
- **Missing composite database indexes**: Added composite indexes for queue polling (status, created_at) and episode lookup (podcast_id, episode_id) to improve query performance.
- **Temp file leak in transcriber**: Replaced deprecated `tempfile.mktemp()` with `NamedTemporaryFile` and ensured cleanup on all failure paths, including FLAC compression failures.
- **Empty transcript crash in ad detector**: Added early return guard before `create_windows()` to prevent IndexError on empty segment lists.
- **Non-atomic podcast metadata updates**: Consolidated three sequential `update_podcast()` calls into a single call to prevent inconsistent state on partial failure.
- **FFMPEG error context missing**: Improved exception message when FFMPEG fails to include ad count and episode duration for easier debugging.
- **Unhandled os.unlink in processing**: Wrapped bare `os.unlink()` in try-except during verification re-cut to prevent processing failures from file cleanup errors.

### Security
- **Login rate limiting tightened**: Reduced from 5/minute to 3/minute with an additional 10/hour cap to slow brute-force attacks.

## [1.0.88] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **RSS feed refresh broken for feeds with new episodes**: v1.0.86 regression -- removing inline date parsing left `published_str` undefined, crashing `refresh_rss_feed` for any feed with discovered episodes. This prevented RSS feeds from updating after processing and blocked auto-process queuing.
- **RSS feed stale after 304 when episodes finish processing**: When upstream returns 304 Not Modified, the periodic refresh returned early without regenerating the modified RSS -- missing any episodes that completed processing since the last full refresh. Now checks if the cached RSS is missing processed episodes and forces a full re-fetch if so.

## [1.0.87] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Copy Feed URL label missing on desktop**: Removed `sm:hidden` from copy button text labels in FeedCard, FeedListItem, and FeedDetail so the label is visible on all screen sizes.

## [1.0.86] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **Episode sorting wrong for pre-v1.0.41 episodes**: Episodes with RFC 2822 `published_at` dates (inserted before v1.0.41 added date normalization) sorted incorrectly because SQLite compares strings lexicographically. Added `_normalize_published_at()` helper to `upsert_episode` so all write paths produce ISO 8601. One-time migration converts existing RFC 2822 values. Also fixed `bulk_upsert_discovered_episodes` ON CONFLICT to prefer the incoming normalized date over stale stored values.

## [1.0.85] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **Mobile copy button too wide**: Copy feed URL buttons in FeedDetail and FeedCard are now icon-only (no text label), matching FeedListItem.
- **Feed URL overflow on mobile**: Feed URL text and label hidden on mobile in FeedDetail (only copy button shown). Truncated URL provided no value and overflowed the card boundary. Full URL still visible on sm+ screens.

## [1.0.84] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Podcast search via PodcastIndex.org**: Search for podcasts by name directly from the Add Feed page. Requires free API credentials from api.podcastindex.org, configurable via Settings or environment variables.
- **PodcastIndex settings section**: New "Podcast Discovery" section in Settings for managing API key and secret, with status badge.
- **PWA support**: MinusPod is now installable as a Progressive Web App on mobile and desktop. Includes service worker with offline caching, app manifest, and home screen icons.
- **OPML export with modified feed URLs**: Export feeds with MinusPod-served ad-free URLs for importing into podcast apps. Original URL export preserved as default.

### Changed
- **Add Feed page redesigned**: Unified input field detects URLs vs. search queries automatically. Search results show artwork, author, and one-click add. Advanced options (slug, auto-process, max episodes) collapsed by default.

### Fixed
- **iPhone safe area padding**: MobileAudioSheet now respects bottom safe area inset on notched devices.
- **Mobile menu not closing on navigation**: Menu now auto-closes when navigating to a new page.
- **GlobalStatusBar expanded view overflow**: Expanded status detail capped at max-h-48 with scrolling.
- **Dashboard toolbar overflow on mobile**: Button row now scrolls horizontally instead of wrapping.
- **Feed URL hidden on mobile**: Feed URL in FeedDetail now visible on all screen sizes.
- **ActionButtons inconsistent disabled states**: Standardized button padding and added disabled:opacity-50 across all variants.
- **PodcastIndex save bar logic**: Save bar now requires both API key and secret to be filled, not just one.
- **Data Management button alignment**: OPML Export and Database Backup buttons now align vertically across cards regardless of description height.
- **Dashboard Export OPML redundancy**: Removed Export OPML button from Dashboard toolbar (already in Settings > Data Management). Heading wraps to its own line on narrow screens.
- **Ad editor mobile-expanded button padding**: Added horizontal padding to mobile-expanded variant buttons so text doesn't touch edges.
- **PWA icons regenerated from favicon.svg**: Icon-192, icon-512, and apple-touch-icon now match the favicon design.
- **Favicon/apple-touch-icon 404 performance**: Added dedicated routes for /favicon.ico and /apple-touch-icon*.png to short-circuit expensive feed route lookups.
- **README podcast search section**: Added built-in podcast search to "Finding Podcast RSS Feeds" documentation.

## [1.0.83] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **Codebase simplification pass**: Consolidated duplicate code, extracted shared utilities, and improved efficiency across backend Python source.
- **Extracted shared utilities**: `parse_iso_datetime()` in `utils/time.py`, `parse_transcript_segments()` and `get_transcript_text_for_range()` in `utils/text.py`, `get_with_retry()` in `utils/http.py`, `calculate_backoff()` in `utils/retry.py` -- replaces inline duplicates across 10+ files.
- **Provider constants moved to config.py**: `PROVIDER_ANTHROPIC`, `PROVIDER_OPENROUTER`, `PROVIDER_OLLAMA`, `PROVIDERS_NON_ANTHROPIC` now defined in `config.py` instead of `llm_client.py`.
- **Webhook service refactored**: Replaced `urllib.request`/`_dispatch_webhook()` with `post_with_retry()`, replaced inline datetime formatting with `utc_now_iso()`, added `WebhookPayload` dataclass. Webhook retry now only retries transient errors (429/5xx) instead of all HTTP errors.
- **Stats query consolidated**: Replaced 7 separate `SELECT COUNT/AVG/SUM` queries in `get_processing_history_stats()` with a single `CASE WHEN` conditional aggregation query.
- **Fingerprint N+1 query fixed**: `_load_fingerprints_from_db()` now uses a single JOIN query instead of per-row `get_ad_pattern_by_id()` calls.
- **LLM client improvements**: Extracted `_log_messages()` to base class, replaced `httpx` with `requests` in Ollama fallback, added 5-minute TTL model list cache.
- **Ad detector cleanup**: Removed `_is_retryable_error()` wrapper (calls `is_retryable_error()` directly), removed `RETRY_CONFIG` dict (uses shared `calculate_backoff()`), removed `DEFAULT_MODEL` re-export (consumers import `DEFAULT_AD_DETECTION_MODEL` from config), renamed `_learn_from_detections` to `learn_from_detections`.
- **Transcriber cleanup**: Removed `format_timestamp()` wrapper (uses `format_vtt_timestamp()` directly), optimized `_should_reload()` to return model name for reuse in `get_instance()`.
- **Processing pipeline**: Replaced inline transcript parsing with `parse_transcript_segments()`, eliminated duplicate `get_audio_duration()` call.
- **Pricing fetcher**: Added retry via `get_with_retry()` to `fetch_openrouter_pricing()` and `fetch_pricepertoken_pricing()`, replaced inline ISO datetime parsing with `parse_iso_datetime()`.

### Removed
- Legacy OpenRouter Whisper migration code in `transcriber.py` (`_LEGACY_BACKEND_OPENROUTER`, migration fallback blocks) -- migration was completed in v1.0.68.
- `_dispatch_webhook()` in webhook_service.py (replaced by `post_with_retry()` from utils).
- `_segments_to_text()` in roll_detector.py (replaced by `get_transcript_text_for_range()` from utils).
- `get_transcript_text_for_range()` in ad_detector.py (moved to utils/text.py).
- `httpx` dependency usage in llm_client.py (replaced with `requests`).
- Legacy `openai` and `wrapper` provider aliases from `PROVIDERS_NON_ANTHROPIC` -- standardized on `openai-compatible` and `ollama` only.

## [1.0.82] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Duplicate pricing fetches across gunicorn workers**: Each worker had its own in-memory `_last_fetch` counter, causing independent pricing fetches on every container start. Added DB-level coordination via `MAX(updated_at)` from `model_pricing` table -- if another worker recently wrote pricing within TTL, the second worker syncs its in-memory timer and skips the HTTP fetch.
- **Pre-roll detection gap in Full reprocess mode**: Full mode (`skip_patterns=True`) bypasses Stages 1 & 2, leaving `detect_preroll()` as the sole safety net for short pre-roll ads. Lowered the ad pattern match threshold from 2 to 1 when `skip_patterns=True` so DAI pre-rolls with a single obvious ad indicator are caught.
- **Prefix match pricing lookup matched wrong models**: `_calculate_token_cost` prefix fallback could match a shorter stored key to a longer distinct model (e.g., `gpt4o` incorrectly matching `gpt4omini`). Added 80% length coverage requirement so stored keys must cover most of the lookup key.
- **Per-window LLM retry retried non-retryable errors**: `_call_llm_for_window` per-window retry loop retried unconditionally, including auth and forbidden errors. Now checks `is_retryable_error()` before entering per-window retries.
- **Raw exception leaked in pricing refresh 502 response**: `POST /system/model-pricing/refresh` returned `str(e)` in the error response, potentially exposing internal paths. Now returns a generic message and logs details server-side.
- **OpenAPI spec gaps**: Added missing `?source=` on `GET /system/model-pricing`, `?page=` on `GET /history`, and `400` response on `GET /settings/models`.
- **Normalization variant suffix case sensitivity**: `normalize_model_key` only stripped lowercase OpenRouter suffixes (`:free`); now handles mixed case (`:Free`, `:Extended`).
- **Pricing upsert dual-constraint tension**: `upsert_fetched_pricing` could hit PK/UNIQUE conflict if scraped data contained duplicate display names. Added pre-loop deduplication by `match_key`.
- **Fingerprint sliding window list allocation**: `_find_matches_fast` created a new list slice per sliding step (~1200x per episode). Refactored `_calculate_similarity` to accept start/end indices, avoiding the copy.
- **LLM client race on `_cached_client`**: Added `_client_lock` to synchronize `get_llm_client()` across threads.
- **Pricing refresh blocks settings save**: `force_refresh_pricing()` in the provider-change settings handler now runs in a background thread instead of blocking the HTTP response.

## [1.0.81] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Stale models on provider switch**: Model dropdown now refetches immediately when switching LLM provider (e.g. Anthropic to OpenRouter). The `GET /settings/models` endpoint accepts an optional `?provider=` query param so the frontend can preview models for a provider before saving settings. React Query key includes the selected provider for automatic cache separation.
- **Missing prices on OpenRouter free models**: `fetch_openrouter_pricing()` no longer skips models where both input and output costs are $0. Free models (`:free` suffix) are now stored with $0 pricing so the UI displays pricing instead of showing nothing.

### Removed
- **Anthropic model alias filtering and resolution**: The `_filter_anthropic_aliases()` filter in `list_models()` and the `resolve_anthropic_alias()` runtime resolution in `get_model()`, `get_verification_model()`, and `get_chapters_model()` were added in v1.0.78-1.0.79 to work around intermittent 400 errors that turned out to be caused by an API key issue, not by Anthropic rejecting alias model IDs. Model IDs from the API and database are now used as-is without filtering or resolution (reverts to v1.0.74 behavior).

## [1.0.80] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Fingerprint scan 1000x slower than expected**: Sliding window fingerprint search spawned 2 subprocesses (ffmpeg + fpcalc) per 2-second step, resulting in ~2378 subprocess calls for a 40-minute episode. Refactored `find_matches()` to pre-compute one full-file fingerprint via a single fpcalc call, then compare by slicing the raw int array in pure Python. Falls back to per-window scanning if full-file fingerprint fails.
- **History page pagination broken**: Frontend sends `page` param but backend only read `offset`, so every page returned the same results. Backend now accepts `page`, converts to offset, and includes `page` in the response. The `offset` param still works for backwards compatibility.
- **API errors abort entire episode processing**: A single LLM window failure (400/500) killed ad detection for the whole episode. Added per-window retry (2 extra attempts with 2s/5s backoff) and skip-on-failure logic so partial results are returned. Only aborts if ALL windows fail. Applied to both detection and verification passes.

## [1.0.79] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Alias filter incorrectly removes new models (Sonnet 4.6, Opus 4.6)**: `_filter_anthropic_aliases()` used family-based grouping that treated `claude-sonnet-4-6` and `claude-opus-4-6` as aliases for their 4.5 counterparts. Replaced `_claude_family()` with `_strip_date_suffix()` so a non-dated model is only filtered when a dated model with the exact same version prefix exists. Restored 4.6 pricing entries in `DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING`.

## [1.0.78] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Use canonical model IDs, filter aliases dynamically**: Anthropic's `models.list()` returns both alias IDs (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6`) and dated inference IDs (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`). Aliases are not reliably accepted by the messages API, causing intermittent 400 errors. `AnthropicClient.list_models()` now dynamically filters out aliases when a dated counterpart exists, so the UI dropdown only shows dated IDs. A safety net resolves any alias stored in DB to its dated counterpart at runtime in `get_model()`, `get_verification_model()`, and `get_chapters_model()`.
- **Token tracking uses requested model ID**: Both `AnthropicClient` and `OpenAICompatibleClient` now record the requested model ID in `LLMResponse.model` instead of `response.model` from the provider, preventing DB fragmentation across model name variants.
- **Remove alias-only pricing entries**: Removed `claude-opus-4-6` and `claude-sonnet-4-6` from `DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING` to prevent silent conflicts with their dated counterparts during `seed_default_pricing()`.

## [1.0.77] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- **Stale models on provider change**: Switching LLM provider in Settings now clears model dropdown selections immediately, preventing stale models from the previous provider from persisting until save.
- **OpenRouter variant suffix normalization**: `normalize_model_key` now strips OpenRouter variant suffixes (`:free`, `:extended`, `:beta`, `:nitro`) before normalization, so `z-ai/glm-4.5-air:free` correctly matches pricing for `glm-4.5-air`.

## [1.0.76] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Migration failure on existing DB**: Seed INSERT into `model_pricing` no longer references `match_key`, `raw_model_id`, or `source` columns that only exist after the ALTER TABLE migration runs. Existing DBs upgrading from pre-1.0.75 schemas will now migrate cleanly.
- **Stale pricing after provider change**: Switching LLM provider now calls `force_refresh_pricing()` to immediately fetch pricing for the new provider, instead of just resetting the TTL and waiting up to 15 minutes for the background loop.
- **Noisy duplicate column log**: Downgraded the "duplicate column name" log in `_add_column_if_missing` from ERROR to WARNING, since this is expected when multiple gunicorn workers race to run the same ALTER TABLE migration.

## [1.0.75] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Multi-provider LLM pricing**: Cost tracking now works for any LLM provider, not just Anthropic. Pricing is fetched live from OpenRouter's API (for OpenRouter users) or scraped from pricepertoken.com (for Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Mistral, DeepSeek, xAI, Together, Fireworks, Perplexity, and Google). Pricing refreshes automatically every 24 hours and on provider change. Local/Ollama providers report $0.
- **Model name normalization**: A `normalize_model_key()` function maps model names across different naming conventions (API IDs, display names, provider-prefixed IDs) to a single lookup key, so pricing matches regardless of source format.
- **Manual pricing refresh endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/system/model-pricing/refresh` forces an immediate pricing data refresh from the active provider's pricing source.
- **Pricing source tracking**: Each model pricing entry now records its source (`openrouter_api`, `pricepertoken`, `default`, `legacy`) and the raw model ID from the pricing source.
- **New dependency**: `beautifulsoup4` for HTML table parsing from pricepertoken.com.

### Changed
- **Schema migration**: `model_pricing` table gains `match_key`, `raw_model_id`, and `source` columns with a UNIQUE index on `match_key`. `token_usage` table gains `match_key` column. Existing rows are backfilled automatically. No data loss.
- **Cost calculation**: `_calculate_token_cost()` now uses normalized `match_key` lookups instead of raw `model_id` matching.
- **Token usage joins**: `get_token_usage_summary()` joins on `match_key` instead of `model_id` for correct pricing display across providers.
- **Model list enrichment**: `_enrich_models_with_pricing()` uses `match_key` lookups and no longer calls `refresh_model_pricing()` directly (pricing comes from background fetch).
- **Default pricing demoted to fallback**: `DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING` is only used when live fetch fails AND the pricing table is empty (air-gapped/offline installs).

## [1.0.74] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Theme system**: User-selectable color themes on the Settings page (Catppuccin Mocha/Macchiato/Frappe, Dracula with 6 accent variants, Nord, Gruvbox, Solarized, Tokyo Night, GitHub Dark, UniFi, Blue Slate). The existing dark/light toggle switches between the light and dark halves of the active theme. Themes persist in localStorage. Frontend-only, no backend changes.

## [1.0.73] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **FFMPEG timeout on long episodes (Issue #88)**: FFMPEG ad-removal timeout now scales with episode duration (5 min base + 5 sec per minute of audio) instead of a hardcoded 300s. A 107-minute episode now gets ~14 minutes instead of 5. Audio preprocessing timeout also scales by file size. Fixes consistent failures on emulated platforms (e.g. amd64 Docker on ARM Macs via Orbstack).

### Changed
- **Dockerfile**: Removed hardcoded `--platform=linux/amd64` from both build stages. Platform should be passed via `docker build --platform` or `docker-compose` config instead of baked into the Dockerfile.

## [1.0.72] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Whisper model reload per chunk causing 2-3x transcription slowdown**: `transcribe_chunked()` was unloading and reloading the Whisper model after every chunk (14-18s reload each time, including HuggingFace API round-trip). Model is now kept loaded across chunks and unloaded once after all chunks complete. GPU cache clearing between chunks is preserved.

## [1.0.71] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- **Stuck episode processing (fingerprint loop)**: Audio fingerprint scanning now has a 10-minute timeout (was unbounded). A 176-minute episode could spawn ~5,280 subprocess iterations with no escape. Scanning now logs progress every 60 seconds, checks for cancellation each iteration, and returns partial results on timeout.
- **Cancel not respected during ad detection**: Cancel events are now checked between all three ad detection stages (fingerprint, text pattern, Claude API) and within the fingerprint scan loop itself. Previously, cancellation was only checked between top-level pipeline stages.
- **Processing queue force-clear safety net**: Jobs stuck for over 2 hours are now force-cleared from the processing queue, even when the lock is held by the same process. This prevents a hung processing thread from blocking all future episode processing indefinitely.

## [1.0.70] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Mobile UI: History page filters cut off**: Status and podcast filter dropdowns now stack vertically on mobile instead of being squeezed side-by-side
- **Mobile UI: Feed detail card overflow**: Podcast artwork and content now stack vertically on mobile; network badges and Edit button wrap instead of overflowing
- **Auto-Process dropdown labels**: Renamed verbose options from "Use Global Setting / Always Enable / Always Disable" to cleaner "Global Default / Enabled / Disabled" on both FeedDetail and AddFeed pages
- **Missing episode descriptions (Relay FM and similar feeds)**: RSS parser now falls back to `itunes:summary`, `itunes:subtitle`, and `content:encoded` when `<description>` is empty. DB upsert also backfills empty descriptions and titles on next feed refresh.

## [1.0.69] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Whisper language misdetection**: Local Whisper backend used `language=None` (auto-detect) which misidentified English podcasts as Spanish (93% confidence on music intros), corrupting transcriptions and generating false ad detections. Now uses `language='en'` matching the API backend. Non-English DAI ads are still caught by text-based heuristics.
- **Ad detection crash on empty LLM response**: When the LLM returns `None` content (empty response, refusal, or content filtering), `ad_detector.py` crashed with `object of type 'NoneType' has no len()`. Both Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible `messages_create` now coerce `None` content to empty string.

## [1.0.68] - 2026-03-15

### Removed
- **OpenRouter as Whisper backend**: OpenRouter does not support the `/v1/audio/transcriptions` endpoint -- all transcription attempts returned 500 errors. The `openrouter-api` whisper backend has been removed from config, settings API, frontend UI, and documentation. Users who had this backend configured will automatically fall back to local Whisper with a warning log. For cloud transcription without a GPU, use `WHISPER_BACKEND=openai-api` with Groq or another OpenAI-compatible provider. OpenRouter remains fully supported as an LLM provider.

## [1.0.67] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **OpenRouter Whisper 413 errors**: Reduced chunk duration from 10 min (600s) to 2.5 min (150s) for OpenRouter backend to stay under payload size limit. OpenAI API backend unchanged at 600s.
- **`_verify_endpoint` logged misleading URL**: Removed unused `base_url` parameter; now reads the actual URL from the client after construction.
- **OpenRouter API key format validation**: Settings API now rejects keys that do not start with `sk-or-`.
- **Frontend: OpenRouter key sent after provider switch**: Clearing `openrouterApiKey` state when switching away from OpenRouter prevents stale key from being saved.

### Added
- Tests for OpenRouter whisper settings auto-population and chunk duration calculation.

## [1.0.66] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **OpenRouter model filtering**: `model_matches_provider` now returns True for OpenRouter (routes to any model), fixing false rejections of claude models via OpenRouter.
- **LLM provider validation**: `llmProvider` is now validated against known providers before DB storage, preventing invalid values from persisting.
- **OpenRouter startup verification**: `verify_llm_connection` now actually calls `verify_connection()` for OpenRouter instead of only checking key presence.
- **Nested ternary in LLMProviderSection**: Extracted `renderApiKeyStatus()` helper for readability.
- **Redundant expose directive**: Removed `expose: "8000"` from `docker-compose.openrouter.yml` (redundant with `ports`).

### Added
- **OpenRouter model/verify tests**: 8 new tests covering `model_matches_provider` for OpenRouter and `verify_llm_connection` OpenRouter paths.

## [1.0.65] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **Whisper API 413 errors**: Convert preprocessed WAV to FLAC (lossless, ~4-5x smaller) before uploading to Whisper API, preventing HTTP 413 (Request Entity Too Large) errors from APIs with tight upload limits (e.g. OpenRouter).

## [1.0.64] - 2026-03-15

### Improved
- **WHISPER_BACKENDS constant**: Frontend whisper backend comparisons now use a shared constant object, matching the existing `LLM_PROVIDERS` pattern.
- **Model sort deduplication**: Alphabetical sort moved into `_enrich_models_with_pricing` to avoid duplicate logic across endpoints.
- **OpenRouter whisper save fix**: Frontend no longer sends empty `whisperApiBaseUrl` for OpenRouter backend, which was overriding the backend's `reset_setting` call.
- **docker-compose.openrouter.yml cleanup**: Removed deprecated `version` key and `RETENTION_PERIOD` env var.

### Added
- **OpenRouter unit tests**: 11 tests covering `get_effective_openrouter_api_key`, `get_llm_client`, `get_api_key`, timeout, and retry logic for the openrouter provider.

## [1.0.63] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **OpenRouter LLM provider**: Use 200+ models via one API key. Set `LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or switch from the Settings UI at runtime.
- **OpenRouter Whisper backend**: `WHISPER_BACKEND=openrouter-api` routes transcription through OpenRouter -- no NVIDIA GPU needed.
- **Frontend OpenRouter UI**: Provider dropdown, inline API key input, and status badges in Settings.
- **docker-compose.openrouter.yml**: Ready-to-use compose file for GPU-free OpenRouter setup.
- **.env.example**: Template covering all LLM and Whisper provider options.
- **curl in Docker image**: For container health checks.
- **README Disclaimer section**: Moved disclaimer to a dedicated section at the bottom with ToC link; converted scattered warnings to footnotes.
- **Alphabetical model sorting**: LLM model dropdowns now sort alphabetically by name.

## [1.0.62] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- **RSS feed cache permanently stale on HTTP 304**: When upstream RSS returned 304 Not Modified, `last_checked_at` was not updated, causing every subsequent request to trigger a redundant refresh. Feeds polled frequently (e.g. PocketCasts every minute) would show thousands of minutes stale and make unnecessary upstream checks.
- **OpenAI gpt-5-mini failing with max_tokens** (fixes #81): Newer OpenAI models require `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`. The OpenAI-compatible client now tries `max_completion_tokens` first and falls back to `max_tokens` for older APIs, caching the result per model.

## [1.0.61] - 2026-03-15

### Security
- **Remove system Python cryptography/PyJWT**: Docker Scout flagged CVEs in Ubuntu 24.04 system packages (`python3-cryptography 41.0.7`, `python3-jwt 2.7.0`) at `/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/`. Our venv already has fixed versions; removed system copies that Scout was scanning. Fixes 6 CVEs.
- **Upgrade setuptools, remove vendored jaraco/wheel**: setuptools bundles old copies of `jaraco.context` and `wheel` in its `_vendor/` directory. Upgraded setuptools and removed vendored copies. Fixes 2 CVEs.
- **torch 2.6.0 CVEs (accepted risk)**: CVE-2025-3730 (Medium, fix: 2.8.0) and CVE-2025-2953 (Low, fix: 2.7.1-rc1) are DoS-only in functions (`ctc_loss`, `mkldnn_max_pool2d`) not used by our pipeline. No stable fix available yet.

## [1.0.60] - 2026-03-15

### Security
- **PyTorch 2.5.0 -> 2.6.0**: Fixes CVE-2025-32434 (CRITICAL, CVSS 9.3) -- RCE via `torch.load` weights_only bypass. CUDA variant moved from cu121 to cu124.
- **cryptography >= 46.0.5**: Fixes CVE-2026-26007 (HIGH, CVSS 8.2), CVE-2023-50782 (HIGH, CVSS 8.7), CVE-2024-26130 (HIGH, CVSS 7.5), CVE-2024-0727 (MEDIUM), GHSA-h4gh-qq45-vh27

### Fixed
- **Gunicorn worker crash on startup (code 134/SIGABRT)**: CTranslate2 4.4.0 requires cuDNN 8 (`libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8`) but PyTorch 2.5.0+ only ships cuDNN 9. Added cuDNN 8 runtime libraries to `/opt/cudnn8/lib` via `nvidia-cudnn-cu12==8.9.7.29` and updated `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. This was causing one worker to abort on every container restart.

## [1.0.59] - 2026-03-14

## [1.0.58] - 2026-03-14

### Changed
- **Docker base image upgrade**: Upgraded from `nvidia/cuda:12.1.1-runtime-ubuntu22.04` to `nvidia/cuda:12.6.3-runtime-ubuntu24.04` to resolve Docker Scout CVEs from outdated Ubuntu 22.04 system packages. Python 3.11 now installed from deadsnakes PPA (Ubuntu 24.04 defaults to 3.12). Pip bootstrapped via `ensurepip` instead of `python3-pip` package. PyTorch continues to bundle its own CUDA/cuDNN via pip, so the base image CUDA version change has no runtime impact.

## [1.0.57] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Verification pass ignoring whisper backend**: Second pass (verification) was hardcoded to use local GPU whisper via `WhisperModelSingleton`, bypassing `WHISPER_BACKEND` config. Now routes through `Transcriber.transcribe()` when backend is `openai-api`, matching first pass behavior. (GitHub #7)
- **SSE queue unbounded growth**: `queue.Queue()` had no maxsize, so `put_nowait` could never raise `queue.Full` -- the "drop if full" logic was dead code. Status updates accumulated unboundedly during long processing runs, causing large SSE payloads. Added `maxsize=50` so stale updates are dropped.
- **Fingerprint comparison TypeError**: `compare_fingerprints()` passed `str` to `chromaprint.decode_fingerprint()` which expects `bytes` (ctypes `c_char` pointer). Now encodes to bytes before calling the C library.
- **Episode ID churn on every refresh**: Acast/Megaphone feeds change RSS GUIDs between fetches, causing repeated "Episode ID changed" warnings. Now updates the stored `episode_id` for discovered episodes to match the new GUID, and downgrades the log from WARNING to DEBUG.
- **Duplicate worker processing (broken leader election)**: `open(lock_path, 'w')` truncated the lock file, creating a race where both Gunicorn workers could acquire `flock()`. Changed to `open(lock_path, 'a')` (append mode) which doesn't truncate, so `flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB)` works correctly.

## [1.0.56] - 2026-03-13

### Changed
- **Settings page reorganization**: Grouped related sections under category headings (AI & Processing, Output, Data & Security) and reordered for logical flow
- Processing Queue section auto-expands when episodes are actively processing
- AI Models section now defaults to open on first visit
- Moved "Reset All Episodes" from System Status into Data Management section

## [1.0.55] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Remote whisper empty segments**: Removed `--convert` flag from `docker-compose.whisper.yml` -- whisper.cpp fails silently when it cannot write temp files to the CWD in Docker, returning 200 with 0 segments. MinusPod already sends preprocessed 16kHz mono WAV so conversion is unnecessary.
- Added `working_dir: /tmp` to whisper compose service as a safety net for any temp file writes
- Added `--no-flash-attn` to whisper compose so DTW word-level timestamps work (flash attention silently disables DTW)
- Log warning when whisper API returns 200 with 0 usable segments, including raw response body for diagnosis

### Changed
- README: Updated Remote Whisper section to document the `--convert` issue and note that MinusPod preprocesses audio to WAV

## [1.0.54] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Remote whisper transcription backend**: OpenAI-compatible HTTP API backend for whisper transcription, enabling use of whisper.cpp (Apple Silicon), Groq, or OpenAI as the inference engine
  - New `whisper_backend` setting: switch between `local` (faster-whisper, default) and `openai-api`
  - Configurable API base URL, API key (write-only), and model name via Settings UI and env vars
  - `WHISPER_BACKEND`, `WHISPER_API_BASE_URL`, `WHISPER_API_KEY`, `WHISPER_API_MODEL` environment variables
  - Fixed 10-minute chunk duration for API backend (fits under 25MB API upload limit)
  - Retry with exponential backoff on 429/5xx responses
  - Settings UI: backend selector with conditional fields matching LLM Provider section pattern
- Unit tests for API transcription response parsing, backend dispatch, and chunk duration
- Integration tests for whisper backend settings round-trip via API

### Changed
- Transcription Settings section now shows backend selector; local model picker only visible when backend is "local"

## [1.0.53] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Podcast name in webhook payloads**: Webhook payloads now include a `podcast` section with `name` and `slug` fields, available as `podcast.name` and `podcast.slug` template variables
- Test webhook and template preview also include podcast name data

## [1.0.52] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **OPML export**: `GET /api/v1/feeds/export-opml` exports all feed subscriptions as OPML 2.0 file
- **Database backup**: `GET /api/v1/system/backup` downloads a consistent SQLite backup (rate limited 6/hour)
- **Outbound webhooks**: Configurable HTTP POST webhooks fired on `episode.processed` and `episode.failed` events
  - Custom Jinja2 payload templates for integration with any HTTP endpoint (Pushover, ntfy, n8n, etc.)
  - Optional HMAC-SHA256 request signing via `X-MinusPod-Signature` header
  - Template validation and live preview via API and Settings UI
  - Fire-and-forget delivery with 2 retry attempts per webhook
- **Webhook management UI**: Full CRUD in Settings > Webhooks section with template editor and test firing
- **Data Management section**: New Settings section with OPML export and database backup download buttons
- **Webhook examples in README**: Pushover and ntfy integration walkthroughs with template examples

### Changed
- **Webhook formatted payload fields**: Added human-readable `processing_time` (M:SS), `llm_cost_display` ($X.XX), and `time_saved` (M:SS) alongside raw numeric values in webhook payloads
- **Webhook README examples**: Pushover and ntfy examples now use pre-formatted fields instead of inline Jinja2 formatting
- **Storage formatting**: Values now auto-format to GB when >= 1024 MB (SystemStatus, EpisodeDetail, FeedDetail, cleanup results)
- **System Status section**: Always expanded on Settings page load (localStorage reset on mount)
- **`formatStorage` utility**: New shared formatter in `settingsUtils.ts` for consistent MB/GB display

### Fixed
- **Storage display consistency**: All storage displays now use the same `formatStorage` formatter instead of inline `.toFixed(1) MB`

## [1.0.51] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Original transcript storage**: First-pass transcript is saved as `original_transcript_text` in episode_details (write-once, preserved across reprocessing) so users can see what was removed
- **Original Transcript panel**: Episode Detail page shows collapsible "Original Transcript" section with raw pre-cut transcript
- **Ad Editor Workflow section in README**: Clarifies that ad preview audio plays processed output intentionally (review-and-reprocess model)

### Changed
- **Transcript panel now collapsible**: Existing transcript display uses `CollapsibleSection` component for consistency with the rest of the app
- **API response includes original transcript**: `originalTranscriptAvailable` boolean in episode detail endpoint; full text lazy-loaded via `/original-transcript` endpoint
- **CollapsibleSection localStorage key**: Added optional `storageKey` prop; episode detail panels use explicit keys instead of `settings-section-*` prefix
- **Shared `_get_episode_db_id` helper**: Lightweight ID lookup extracted for `save_episode_details`, `save_original_transcript`, `save_episode_audio_analysis`, `clear_episode_details`
- **Original transcript routed through Storage layer**: `storage.save_original_transcript()` for consistency with other transcript operations

### Fixed
- **`_get_episode_db_id` return type**: Annotation now `-> Optional[int]` matching actual behavior (returns `None` when not found)
- **`get_original_transcript` two-query overhead**: Collapsed `_get_episode_db_id` + SELECT into a single JOIN query
- **Original transcript spinner on error**: Destructure `isError` from query; show error message instead of infinite `LoadingSpinner`
- **Original transcript section empty on revisit**: Initialize `originalTranscriptRequested` from localStorage so query fires when section was previously opened
- **Original transcript query fires without availability check**: Added `originalTranscriptAvailable` guard to query `enabled` condition to prevent spurious API calls
- **README ToC**: Trimmed deeply nested sub-items to top-level sections with select sub-items

### Note
- Episodes processed before v1.0.51 will not have an original transcript. To populate it, reprocess the episode -- the next transcription will be captured as the original.

## [1.0.50] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **CDN-not-ready episodes permanently failing too fast**: JIT route retries bypassed queue backoff, burning all 3 retries in ~34 seconds. Added exponential cooldown (60s/120s/240s) between JIT retries so CDN propagation has time to complete. Returns 503 with Retry-After header during cooldown.

## [1.0.49] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **AudioMetadata unbounded cache**: Added `_MAX_CACHE_SIZE = 500` with LRU eviction to prevent memory leak on long-running servers
- **Unused axios dependency**: Removed `axios` from frontend dependencies (codebase uses `fetch` via `apiRequest()`)
- **Dockerfile missing platform**: Added `--platform=linux/amd64` to both FROM statements per project guidelines

### Improved
- **Centralized LLM model constants**: Moved `DEFAULT_AD_DETECTION_MODEL` and `DEFAULT_CHAPTERS_MODEL` to `config.py`; `ad_detector.py` and `chapters_generator.py` import from config
- **Standardized import aliases**: Removed inconsistent `_get_audio_duration` / `_utils_get_audio_duration` aliases in `audio_processor.py`, `transcriber.py`, `audio_fingerprinter.py`; all now use direct `from utils.audio import get_audio_duration`
- **Frontend query string builder**: Extracted `buildQueryString()` utility in `api/client.ts`; refactored `feeds.ts`, `history.ts`, `search.ts`, `patterns.ts` to use it
- **Volume threshold in config**: Moved `VolumeAnalyzer` default `anomaly_threshold_db` (3.0) to `config.py` as `VOLUME_ANOMALY_THRESHOLD_DB`

### Post-Review Fixes
- **CRITICAL: `get_podcast_id` missing method**: `cleanup_duplicate_episodes()` in `database/maintenance.py` called nonexistent `get_podcast_id()`; replaced with `get_podcast_by_slug()` + id extraction
- **Duplicate `MAX_EPISODE_RETRIES` constant**: Removed independent definitions from `main_app/routes.py`, `processing.py`, and `background.py`; all three now import from `config.py`
- **Split `_permanently_failed_warned` set**: Created `main_app/shared_state.py` with shared set; `routes.py` and `processing.py` both import from it, restoring cross-module log dedup
- **Duplicate json import in routes.py**: Removed `import json as _json` alias, replaced `_json.xxx` calls with `json.xxx`
- **Unused inter-mixin import in stats.py**: Removed dead `from database.settings import DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING` import
- **Inline imports in main_app/__init__.py**: Moved `import threading`, `import json`, `import secrets` to top-level; kept `from version import __version__` deferred (path constraint)
- **Inline `import json as _json` in processing.py**: Moved `json` import to top-level, removed inline alias in `_run_audio_analysis()`

### Smoke Test Fixes
- **Settings reset missing keys**: `POST /settings/ad-detection/reset` did not reset `min_cut_confidence` or `auto_process_enabled`; added both to `reset_ad_detection_settings()` in `api/settings.py` and to the `defaults` dict in `database/settings.py`
- **Frontend README stale dependency**: Updated `frontend/README.md` to reference Fetch API instead of removed Axios dependency

### Refactored
- **database.py -> database/ package**: Split 4170-line monolith into 12-file package with mixin classes (SchemaMixin, PodcastMixin, EpisodeMixin, SettingsMixin, PatternMixin, SponsorMixin, StatsMixin, MaintenanceMixin, FingerprintMixin, QueueMixin, SearchMixin). All downstream imports preserved.
- **api.py -> api/ package**: Split 3616-line monolith into 11-file package with Flask Blueprint sub-modules (feeds, episodes, history, settings, system, patterns, sponsors, status, auth, search). All routes preserved.
- **main.py -> main_app/ package**: Split 2043-line monolith into 6-file package (cache, feeds, background, processing, routes). Updated entrypoint.sh for `main_app:app`.
- **AdEditor.tsx -> components**: Split 1022-line component into orchestrator + 8 sub-components in `ad-editor/` directory. Deduplicated BoundaryControls (3x -> 1x with variant prop) and ActionButtons (3x -> 1x with variant prop).
- **Settings.tsx -> sections**: Split 963-line page into orchestrator + 11 section components + `settingsUtils.ts` in `settings/` directory. SecuritySection owns its own password state.

## [1.0.48] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Patterns page table overflow**: Switched to `table-fixed` layout with proportional `<colgroup>` widths so all 8 columns fit within the viewport without horizontal scrolling
- **Long podcast names in Scope column**: Added truncation to podcast scope badges to prevent layout blowout
- **Sponsor column overflow**: Added `overflow-hidden` and `truncate` to sponsor name and text template cells
- **Column padding**: Tightened padding on narrow columns (ID, Confirmed, False Pos., Status) from `px-4` to `px-2`

## [1.0.47] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **observed_duration truthiness bug**: `pattern_service.record_pattern_match()` now uses `is not None` check so duration=0.0 is not silently dropped
- **Claude feedback double-update**: Duration feedback loop now tracks updated pattern IDs in a set, preventing inflation of `duration_samples` when multiple Claude ads overlap the same pattern region
- **Claude feedback routed through pattern_service**: `ad_detector` now calls `pattern_service.update_duration()` instead of bypassing the service layer with a direct `db.update_pattern_duration()` call

### Improved
- **Unified boundary scanning**: Extracted shared `_scan_for_boundary()` from near-duplicate `_scan_for_intro` / `_scan_for_outro` methods
- **Exclusive bucket assignment**: Patterns now go into their single closest TF-IDF bucket instead of potentially landing in multiple overlapping buckets

### Added
- **Tests**: Boundary scanning (5 tests), duration estimation edge cases (6 tests), Claude feedback dedup (2 tests)

## [1.0.46] - 2026-03-11

### Improved
- **Pattern matching accuracy**: Paired boundary scanning -- when an intro phrase is matched, scan forward for the outro (and vice versa) before falling back to duration estimation
- **Duration tracking**: Patterns now store avg_duration and duration_samples; used for boundary estimation when paired phrase not found
- **Duration feedback from Claude**: When Claude detections overlap pattern regions >= 50%, pattern avg_duration is updated toward Claude's more accurate boundaries
- **Sentence-boundary extraction**: Intro/outro phrases extracted at sentence boundaries instead of naive word counts, improving fuzzy match quality
- **Proportional TF-IDF windows**: Short ad patterns scored against smaller windows (500-char buckets) instead of fixed 1500-char, reducing score dilution
- **Merge canonical selection**: merge_similar_patterns() now picks the highest confirmation_count pattern as canonical (length as tiebreaker)
- **Atomic confirmation counting**: record_pattern_match() uses increment_pattern_match() instead of race-prone read-then-write
- **Default ad duration estimate**: Increased from 60s to 90s to better match typical sponsor reads

## [1.0.45] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Auto-processing self-match**: Dedup check in auto-process loop matched the episode's own record, preventing all new episodes from being queued. Added `episode_id != ep['id']` guard so dedup only triggers for genuinely different episode rows.
- **Duplicate episode rows from GUID changes**: `bulk_upsert_discovered_episodes` now checks for existing episodes with same title+date before inserting, preventing duplicate rows when RSS feeds change GUIDs. Backfills `episode_number` on existing rows if missing.
- **Sort broken for NULL `published_at`**: "Newest First" sort now uses `COALESCE(published_at, created_at)` so episodes with NULL `published_at` (from pre-v1.0.43 processing) sort by creation date instead of sinking to the bottom.
- **ON CONFLICT doesn't backfill NULL fields**: `bulk_upsert_discovered_episodes` ON CONFLICT clause now backfills NULL `published_at`, `original_url`, `title`, `description`, and `artwork_url` from RSS data without overwriting existing values.

## [1.0.44] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Duplicate `db.get_episode` query in `serve_episode`**: `_lookup_episode()` now accepts an optional pre-fetched episode row, eliminating a redundant JOIN query on the DB fallback path.
- **Inaccurate log message**: Error log for episode not found now says "not found in RSS or database" instead of just "in RSS".
- **Type hint `List[Dict] = None`**: Changed to `Optional[List[Dict]] = None` in `modify_feed()` signature.
- **Redundant `get_podcast_by_slug` in `get_processed_episodes_for_feed`**: Method now accepts `podcast_id` directly instead of resolving slug internally, avoiding an unnecessary GROUP BY query when the caller already has the podcast dict.

## [1.0.43] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **Episode sort by episode number**: Episodes can now be sorted by episode number (from `itunes:episode` tag), publish date, or creation date. Sort dropdown on feed detail page with options: Newest First, Oldest First, Episode # High-Low, Episode # Low-High.
- **`episode_number` field**: Parsed from RSS `itunes:episode` tag end-to-end -- RSS parsing, DB storage, API response (`episodeNumber`), and RSS feed output.
- **`sort_by` / `sort_dir` API params**: `GET /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/episodes` now accepts `sort_by` (published_at, created_at, episode_number, title, status) and `sort_dir` (asc, desc).
- **Processed episodes appended beyond RSS cap**: RSS feed now appends processed episodes from the DB that fall outside the `max_episodes` cap. Podcast clients can see and download older processed episodes that would otherwise be invisible.
- **DB fallback for old episodes**: `_lookup_episode()` now falls back to the database when an episode is not in the upstream RSS feed (e.g., dropped off due to age/cap). On-demand processing works for any discovered episode.

### Fixed
- **Artwork missing after DB restore**: Feed refresh returning 304 (unchanged) now checks if artwork is cached. If artwork is missing (e.g., after a DB restore), forces a full fetch to re-extract and download artwork instead of returning early.
- **Artwork extraction missing itunes:image fallback**: Podcast-level artwork extraction now falls back to `itunes:image` when the standard RSS `<image>` tag is absent, matching the pattern already used for episode-level artwork in `rss_parser.py`.
- **Self-healing artwork endpoint**: When both the cached artwork file and `artwork_url` are missing (e.g., after extraction failures), the artwork endpoint now fetches the source RSS feed, extracts the artwork URL, persists it to the DB, and downloads the image on-demand instead of returning 404.
- **`return undefined as T` in apiRequest**: Changed to `return {} as T` to prevent runtime TypeError when callers destructure empty/204 responses.
- **`cleanup_old_episodes` crash with `storage=None`**: Now raises `ValueError` early instead of crashing with `AttributeError` deep in the call stack.
- **Bulk actions N+1 DB queries**: Replaced per-episode DB calls in `delete_episodes`, `bulk_episode_action` (process/reprocess/delete) with batch methods (`batch_clear_episode_details`, `batch_reset_episodes_to_discovered`, `batch_set_episodes_pending`). For 500 episodes, reduces ~2000 DB calls to ~3.
- **Artwork 404 for feeds with stale cache flag**: When artwork file is missing on disk but `artwork_cached=1` in DB, the artwork endpoint now clears the stale flag, re-extracts the URL from the source feed (including empty-string sentinels from prior failed extractions), and re-downloads. Also fixes `download_artwork` short-circuit that trusted the DB flag without verifying the file exists.
- **Processing overwrites `published_at` with NULL**: `serve_episode()` now passes `published_at` to background processing. `process_episode()` defensively skips `published_at` when None to avoid overwriting a good value. Fixes episodes dropping to bottom of "Newest First" sort during processing.

## [1.0.42] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **Migration CASCADE data loss**: v1.0.41 migrations that rebuild the `episodes` table (DROP + recreate for CHECK constraints) triggered `ON DELETE CASCADE` on `episode_details`, destroying transcripts, ad markers, VTT, chapters, and LLM data. Migrations now disable `PRAGMA foreign_keys` before the DROP TABLE sequence and re-enable after commit.
- **304 bypass prevents episode discovery**: Feeds returning HTTP 304 (unchanged) now check for *discovered* episodes specifically (not total count). Feeds with only completed/processed episodes (zero discovered) correctly force a full fetch for initial discovery.
- **Console error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'payload')"**: `apiRequest` now guards against empty/non-JSON responses (204 No Content, missing content-type) instead of unconditionally calling `response.json()`.

### Removed
- Fallback placeholder UI for missing episode details (no longer needed with safe migration preserving data).

## [1.0.41] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Episode discovery**: All episodes from a feed are now surfaced in the MinusPod UI as `discovered` on every feed refresh. Users can process any episode at any time. Episode records persist indefinitely regardless of retention settings.
- **Bulk episode actions**: Select multiple episodes on the feed detail page and apply Process, Reprocess (Patterns + AI), Reprocess (Full), or Delete in one action. Bulk actions are page-scoped with per-action eligibility enforcement.
- **Episode pagination**: Feed detail episode list is paginated (default 25 per page, options: 25 / 50 / 100 / 500).
- **Per-feed RSS episode cap**: New `maxEpisodes` setting controls how many episodes are served to podcast clients (default 300, max 500). Configurable on add or via feed settings. Changing the cap triggers a full feed refresh.
- **Retention UI**: Retention period now configurable in Settings (days, or disabled).
- **`POST /api/v1/system/vacuum`**: Trigger SQLite VACUUM for manual disk space reclamation. API-only.
- **`POST /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/episodes/bulk`**: Bulk episode actions API.
- **`GET/PUT /api/v1/settings/retention`**: Retention configuration API.

### Changed
- **Retention behaviour**: Retention now deletes audio files and resets episodes to `discovered` instead of hard-deleting episode rows. Episode records, processing history, ad markers, and corrections are preserved. Measured in days (default 30) instead of minutes (default 1440). `RETENTION_PERIOD` env var is deprecated but still supported (converted from minutes on first startup).
- **RSS episode cap default raised**: From 100 to 300.
- **Episodes list default page size**: From 50 to 25. Max increased from 200 to 500.
- **Code quality**: Extracted `_reset_episode_to_discovered()` helper to eliminate 3x duplicated 10-field upsert calls. Extracted shared `EPISODE_STATUS_COLORS`/`EPISODE_STATUS_LABELS` constants from duplicated frontend dicts. Replaced N+1 `get_episode()` calls in bulk actions and `delete_episodes()` with batch `get_episodes_by_ids()` query. Removed dead fallback path in `cleanup_old_episodes()`. Simplified URLSearchParams construction in `getEpisodes()`.

### Fixed
- **0 episodes shown in UI for new feeds**: Episode records are now created on feed refresh rather than only on processing.
- **Feed history truncated to ~3-4 years**: Hardcoded 100-episode RSS cap raised and made configurable.
- **Retention deleting discovered episodes**: Retention now skips episodes with no files on disk, eliminating pointless DB churn.
- **processing_history orphaned by retention**: Episode rows are no longer hard-deleted, so processing_history rows always have a corresponding episode record.
- **Episode checkboxes outside card boundary on mobile**: Checkboxes now render inside the card at top-left with themed styling matching dark theme. Custom Checkbox component replaces native browser checkboxes.
- **Inconsistent episode card heights on mobile**: Removed JS `substring(0,150)` truncation that fought CSS `line-clamp-2`. Moved status badge to metadata row to prevent title wrapping.
- **Edit form (Network/DAI/Feed cap) overflows card on mobile**: Changed to stacked vertical layout with fixed-width labels.
- **"API Docs" link wraps on narrow Settings page**: Added `whitespace-nowrap` to prevent text breaking.

## [1.0.40] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed
- **HEAD requests triggering JIT processing**: Podcast clients (e.g. Pocket Casts) send HEAD requests during feed refresh to probe episode metadata. Flask auto-handles HEAD by running the full GET handler, which triggered the JIT processing pipeline for unprocessed episodes. HEAD requests on unprocessed episodes now proxy upstream audio headers without triggering processing. Completes the fix for #61 (auto-process queue path was fixed in v1.0.37-1.0.39, JIT path was not).

### Changed
- **Extracted `_lookup_episode()` helper**: Single RSS fetch+parse returns episode data and podcast name for both HEAD and GET paths, replacing the earlier `_get_original_episode_url()` which caused duplicate RSS fetches on the GET path.
- **Narrowed exception handling in `_head_upstream()`**: Catches `requests.exceptions.RequestException` instead of bare `Exception`.
- **Use centralized User-Agent**: `_head_upstream()` uses `APP_USER_AGENT` from config instead of hardcoded string.

## [1.0.39] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Silent worker death causing orphan-retry-exhaustion loop**: Episodes stuck in a death loop where Gunicorn SIGKILL (due to default 30s timeout) killed workers mid-processing, orphan detection incremented retry count, and after 3 cycles episodes were marked permanently_failed despite never truly failing.
- **Gunicorn timeout too short**: Added explicit `--timeout 600` (10min heartbeat) and `--graceful-timeout 330` (5min+30s buffer for graceful shutdown) to prevent premature SIGKILL during long audio processing.
- **graceful_shutdown blocking heartbeats**: Signal handler no longer blocks in a sleep loop waiting for processing to finish. Sets shutdown_event and returns immediately, letting Gunicorn's graceful-timeout manage the lifecycle.
- **Orphan resets penalizing retry count**: Both `reset_stuck_processing_episodes` (episodes table) and `reset_orphaned_queue_items` (auto_process_queue) no longer increment retry/attempt counters on orphan detection. Only actual processing failures increment counters.
- **Uncaught exceptions in _process_episode_background**: The outer `except Exception` handler now calls `_handle_processing_failure` for proper GPU cleanup, retry logic, and error recording instead of just logging.
- **"permanently failed" log spam**: Warning for permanently failed episodes on the serve route now only logs once per episode per process lifetime (subsequent requests log at DEBUG level).
- **OpenAPI spec missing `permanently_failed` status**: Added `permanently_failed` to the episode status enum in the `EpisodeSummary` schema and the `listEpisodes` status query parameter filter. Bumped spec version to 1.0.39.
- **Wasted DB query on every episode processing call**: Moved `db.get_episode()` (3-table JOIN) from the top of `_process_episode_background` into the `except` block where it is actually used, eliminating a redundant query on every happy-path and cancellation-path invocation.

## [1.0.38] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Auto-process race on feed creation**: New feeds could queue episodes for processing before the user could disable auto-process. The `POST /feeds` endpoint now accepts `autoProcessOverride` so the override is applied before the initial RSS refresh runs.
- **Cancel does not stop in-flight processing**: The cancel endpoint previously reset DB status but did not signal the running thread. Added cooperative cancellation using `threading.Event` with checkpoints between pipeline stages. Cancelling now actually stops the processing thread and cleans up partial output files.
- **Cancel endpoint race with background thread**: Cancel endpoint no longer resets DB status when a live thread is signalled -- the thread handles DB reset, file cleanup, and queue release to prevent re-queue races. Endpoint only does direct cleanup as a stuck-episode fallback.
- **Duplicated auto_process_override conversion**: Extracted `_serialize_auto_process` / `_deserialize_auto_process` helpers replacing identical 6-line if/elif blocks in 3 API endpoints. Non-boolean values now consistently map to None.

### Added
- **Auto-process dropdown on Add Feed page**: Users can set auto-process to "Always Enable", "Always Disable", or "Use Global Setting" when adding a feed, eliminating the race window.
- **Cancel module** (`cancel.py`): Extracted cancel primitives (event registry, `ProcessingCancelled`, `_check_cancel`, `cancel_processing`) from `main.py` for independent testability without Flask/CUDA imports.
- **Unit tests for cancel and serialization**: 22 new tests covering cancel mechanism (signal, no-op, isolation, cleanup) and auto-process override serialization (roundtrips, edge cases).

## [1.0.37] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed
- **Auto-process "Always Disable" not respected (#61)**: Queue processor now checks `is_auto_process_enabled_for_podcast()` before processing each dequeued episode. Episodes queued before the setting was changed are marked completed and skipped.
- **Database lock errors on fresh install (#62)**: Added file-lock leader election so only one Gunicorn worker starts background threads (RSS refresh, queue processor). Prevents duplicate threads across worker processes from causing SQLite write contention.
- **Defensive mkdir for lock file**: Lock file directory is now created before opening, preventing failures in non-Docker environments where DATA_DIR may not exist yet.
- **Initial RSS refresh runs in all workers**: Moved initial feed refresh inside the leader-election block so only the leader worker performs it, avoiding SQLite contention on startup.

### Added
- **Audiobookshelf documentation**: Added README note about Audiobookshelf's SSRF filter blocking local MinusPod instances, with `SSRF_REQUEST_FILTER_WHITELIST` configuration instructions.
- **Audiobookshelf ToC entry**: Added Audiobookshelf subsection link to README Table of Contents.

## [1.0.36] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed
- **Thread-safe provider cache**: Added `threading.Lock` to protect `_provider_cache` reads, writes, and clears in `llm_client.py`, preventing race conditions under concurrent requests.
- **Reset settings consistency**: `reset_ad_detection_settings()` now uses `db.reset_setting()` for `llm_provider` and `openai_base_url` instead of manually re-deriving env var defaults, matching the pattern used by every other setting in the function.
- **URL format validation**: `openaiBaseUrl` setting now validated via `urlparse` before storing -- rejects values without a valid `http://` or `https://` scheme or missing hostname.
- **Security subtitle clarity**: Settings Security section shows "No password set - app is publicly accessible" instead of bare "No password set".
- **LLM message logging**: Multi-part (list-type) message content now extracts text parts for readable debug logs instead of dumping raw `str()` representation, in both Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible clients.

### Changed
- **Provider constants ordering**: `PROVIDER_ANTHROPIC`, `PROVIDER_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE`, `PROVIDER_OLLAMA`, `PROVIDERS_NON_ANTHROPIC` moved before the functions that reference them in `llm_client.py`.
- **CollapsibleSection useEffect comment**: Added explanatory comment for the intentional missing dependency array on the re-measure `useEffect`.

## [1.0.35] - 2026-03-02

### Fixed
- **Provider-aware API key badge**: Settings UI now shows muted "Not required" badge for Ollama and OpenAI-compatible providers instead of a misleading yellow "Not configured" warning.
- **Provider-aware model injection**: `_ensure_configured_models_present()` no longer injects stale model IDs from a previous provider (e.g. claude-* models no longer appear in Ollama model dropdowns after switching providers).
- **Password input autocomplete warnings**: Added `autoComplete` attributes to Settings page password inputs (`current-password`, `new-password`) to resolve Chrome DevTools DOM warnings and improve password manager integration.

### Changed
- **Refresh button label**: Model refresh button now shows "Refresh" text alongside the icon (and "Refreshing..." with spinner when loading) instead of being icon-only.
- **Provider string constants**: Replaced all inline `'anthropic'`/`'openai-compatible'`/`'ollama'` string literals with named constants (`PROVIDER_ANTHROPIC`, `PROVIDER_OLLAMA`, `PROVIDERS_NON_ANTHROPIC` in backend; `LLM_PROVIDERS` + `LlmProvider` type in frontend). Eliminates typo risk and centralizes provider vocabulary.
- **hasChanges derived value**: Settings page `hasChanges` converted from `useState`+`useEffect` to `useMemo`, removing stale-state edge case after save.
- **Inline spinners consolidated**: Replaced hand-rolled SVG spinner in Settings refresh button and border spinner in AddFeed OPML import with shared `LoadingSpinner` component (new `inline` prop).
- **Duplicate pricing code extracted**: `_enrich_models_with_pricing()` helper replaces identical try/except blocks in `get_available_models()` and `refresh_models()` API routes.

## [1.0.34] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Runtime LLM provider switching**: `LLM_PROVIDER` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` are now stored in the database and configurable via the settings UI. No container restart required to switch between Anthropic, Ollama, or OpenAI-compatible providers.
- **LLM Provider settings section**: New "LLM Provider" section in settings with provider dropdown, base URL input (for non-Anthropic), and API key status badge.
- **Model refresh endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/settings/models/refresh` forces a fresh model list fetch from the active provider. Refresh button added to AI Models section header.
- **Empty models warning**: Yellow banner in AI Models section when the provider returns no models, guiding users to check configuration.
- **LLM I/O logging**: New `podcast.llm_io` logger captures full request/response data at DEBUG level and metadata (model, token counts, response length) at INFO level. Uses intelligent truncation (head 80% + tail 20%) for large content.
- **Collapsible settings sections**: Settings page redesigned with 10 collapsible sections (persisted to localStorage). Reduces visual clutter and improves mobile usability.
- **Sticky save bar**: Save/Reset buttons now appear in a fixed bottom bar when changes are pending, always reachable regardless of scroll position.

### Changed
- **Settings page consolidation**: Merged 12 separate cards into 10 collapsible sections. AI Model, Verification Pass, and Chapters Model merged into single "AI Models" section. Audio Output Quality and Audio Analysis merged into "Audio" section. Ad Detection Aggressiveness and Auto-Process merged into "Ad Detection" section.
- **Responsive prompt textareas**: Reduced from 12 rows to 6 on mobile for better viewport utilization.
- **Provider reads centralized**: All `os.environ.get('LLM_PROVIDER')` calls replaced with `get_effective_provider()` which checks DB first with 5s TTL cache. Same for base URL via `get_effective_base_url()`.

### Removed
- **Fallback models list**: `FALLBACK_MODELS` hardcoded list removed from `llm_client.py`. Both `AnthropicClient` and `OpenAICompatibleClient` now return empty lists on API failure instead of stale fallbacks, making provider misconfiguration immediately visible.

## [1.0.33] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Provider-aware model seeds**: `_seed_default_settings()` now uses `LLM_PROVIDER` and `OPENAI_MODEL` env vars when seeding `verification_model` and `chapters_model`. Fresh Ollama installs no longer get hardcoded Anthropic model names that would 404.
- **Provider-aware `reset_setting()`**: Resetting `claude_model`, `verification_model`, or `chapters_model` now respects `LLM_PROVIDER`/`OPENAI_MODEL` instead of always resetting to Anthropic constants.
- **Non-Anthropic provider timeouts**: `get_llm_timeout()` and `get_llm_max_retries()` now apply extended timeouts/reduced retries for all non-Anthropic providers (`openai-compatible`, `wrapper`, `ollama`), not just `ollama`.
- **UI staleness after processing**: `GlobalStatusBar` SSE handler now invalidates React Query caches when a job completes or a feed refresh finishes, so `FeedDetail`, `EpisodeDetail`, and `Dashboard` auto-update without manual refresh.

### Changed
- **README**: Renamed "Claude Model" to "AI Model" in settings docs to match UI. Fixed `OPENAI_MODEL` env var table to show no default (was misleadingly showing the Anthropic model name).

## [1.0.32] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Chapters model DB lookup broken**: `get_chapters_model()` used `from database import PodcastDatabase` but the class is actually `Database`. Both the `chapters_model` and `claude_model` DB lookups silently failed via the caught exception, causing the function to always fall through to the hardcoded Anthropic model name -- breaking Ollama setups even after the 1.0.31 provider-aware fallback was added.

## [1.0.31] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **TextPatternMatcher vectorizer crash**: Guard `_load_patterns()` against None vectorizer. When `skip_patterns=True` (AI-only reprocess mode), `_ensure_initialized()` was never called, but pattern creation still triggered `_load_patterns()` which called `self._vectorizer.fit()` on None. Now auto-initializes the vectorizer on demand, with a graceful fallback if sklearn is unavailable.
- **Chapters model 404 on Ollama**: `get_chapters_model()` now falls back to the user's primary detection model (`claude_model` DB setting) when `LLM_PROVIDER` is not `anthropic`, instead of hardcoding `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` which Ollama doesn't have.

### Added
- **Chapters model DB seed**: `_seed_default_settings()` now seeds `chapters_model` with a provider-aware default so fresh Ollama installs get a valid model out of the box.
- **README table of contents**: Added a linked table of contents for easier navigation.

## [1.0.30] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Ollama single-object response parsing**: qwen3 (and potentially other models) return a bare JSON object `{...}` instead of an array `[{...}]` when detecting a single ad. The parser now detects objects with start/end timestamp keys and wraps them in an array, preventing silent ad drops. Anthropic code path is unaffected (always returns arrays).

### Added
- **LLM response logging**: Raw LLM response text is now logged at INFO level (first 500 chars) for both detection and verification windows. Enables debugging unexpected model output via Grafana without needing to query the database.
- **Reasoning field logging**: `OpenAICompatibleClient` now logs the presence and size of reasoning/chain-of-thought fields (e.g. qwen3 think mode) at DEBUG level.

### Changed
- **README model tables**: Replaced single flat model recommendation table with per-pass tables (Pass 1 / Verification / Chapters) reflecting that different passes have different model requirements.

## [1.0.29] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Ollama LLM timeouts**: Made LLM request timeouts and retry counts provider-aware. Ollama/local models now get 600s timeout (up from 120s) and 2 retries (down from 3) since local inference is much slower than cloud APIs. Fixes `Window N API error: Request timed out` when using `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama`.
- **Chapters generator missing timeout**: All 3 LLM calls in `chapters_generator.py` previously inherited the 120s default timeout. Now explicitly pass the provider-aware timeout.

### Added
- `LLM_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT`, `LLM_TIMEOUT_LOCAL`, `LLM_RETRY_MAX_RETRIES`, `LLM_RETRY_MAX_RETRIES_LOCAL` constants in `config.py`
- `get_llm_timeout()` and `get_llm_max_retries()` helpers in `llm_client.py`

## [1.0.28] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Ollama model listing 404**: Auto-append `/v1` to `OPENAI_BASE_URL` when `LLM_PROVIDER=ollama` and the URL doesn't already end with `/v1`. Fixes 404 errors on model listing and chat completions (`GET /models` -> `GET /v1/models`).
- **Ollama native fallback**: Added `_try_ollama_native_list()` method that queries Ollama's native `/api/tags` endpoint as a fallback when the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` endpoint fails. Used in both model listing and connection verification.

### Changed
- **Generic LLM naming in UI**: Replaced all user-facing "Claude" references with "AI" in Settings page ("AI Model"), EpisodeDetail reprocess buttons ("Patterns + AI", "Skip patterns, AI only"), and FeedDetail reprocess menus/modals.
- **Generic LLM naming in API docs**: Updated OpenAPI spec to use "AI model" / "AI analysis" instead of "Claude" in descriptions for model selection, reprocess modes, settings, and confidence fields. Example model values kept as-is.

## [1.0.27] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Configurable chapters model**: Chapter generation no longer hardcodes Haiku. New `chapters_model` DB setting with `get_chapters_model()` function, exposed via Settings API and UI dropdown (visible when chapters are enabled). Defaults to `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for Anthropic users; Ollama users can select any available model.

### Changed
- **Ollama recommended models table**: Updated README table with Qwen 3.5 family models, added "Size on Disk" column, refreshed entries across all VRAM tiers.

## [1.0.26] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Ollama model filter**: Removed name-based filter in `OpenAICompatibleClient.list_models()` that only showed models containing "claude", "gpt", or "llama". All models reported by the endpoint are now listed, so Ollama models like qwen3, mistral, and phi4-mini appear correctly.
- **Ollama fallback models**: `OpenAICompatibleClient._get_fallback_models()` now returns the configured `OPENAI_MODEL` value instead of hardcoded Claude models.
- **Ollama startup blocked by API key check**: `get_api_key()` now defaults to `"not-needed"` for non-anthropic providers. `verify_llm_connection()` restructured so Ollama/openai-compatible providers skip the API key gate and go straight to the endpoint connection test.
- **README env var table**: Added `ollama` as a valid `LLM_PROVIDER` value. Added missing `OPENAI_MODEL` row.

### Added
- **README Ollama section**: Dedicated documentation covering Ollama setup, recommended models by VRAM tier, accuracy comparison vs Claude, and JSON reliability risks.

## [1.0.25] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **README accuracy**: Merged "System Status" bullet into "Settings" (it is a section within Settings, not a standalone page)
- **Frontend README**: Updated outdated component reference from `TranscriptEditor.tsx` to `AdEditor.tsx`
- **OpenAPI spec version**: Updated from 1.0.0 to match actual app version
- **OpenAPI corrections endpoint**: Fixed path from `/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episodeId}/corrections` to `/episodes/{slug}/{episodeId}/corrections` to match api.py
- **OpenAPI reprocess endpoint**: Fixed path from `/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episodeId}/reprocess` to `/episodes/{slug}/{episodeId}/reprocess` to match preferred endpoint with mode support

## [1.0.24] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **Updated README**: Renamed "Transcript Editor" section to "Ad Editor" with updated feature descriptions covering time adjustment controls, reason panel, pill selector, and audio auto-seek. Removed outdated transcript-specific features (swipe gestures, double-tap/long-press boundary setting).
- **Refreshed all screenshots**: Recaptured all 15 desktop and mobile screenshots from the live server reflecting the current UI with MinusPod logo, updated ad editor layout, and new time controls.

## [1.0.23] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- **Audio seek on ad switch**: Clicking ad pills, navigating with next/prev, or auto-advancing after confirm/save now seeks the audio to the new ad's start time. Previously the progress bar stayed at its old position.

### Changed
- **Mobile bottom sheet redesign**: Start/End time controls now stack vertically (one per row) instead of side-by-side, fixing cut-off inputs on narrow screens. Progress bar moved to top of bottom sheet for full width. Action buttons use full-width flex row with inline icon+text. Input font bumped to 16px (text-base) for readability. Reduced internal padding (px-3) to reclaim screen space on mobile.
- **Desktop time controls visibility**: Stepper buttons use filled bg-muted background instead of ghost border for clearer interactivity. Labels uppercase with tracking. Icons and text use text-foreground instead of text-muted-foreground.
- **Tighter mobile spacing**: Header, pill selector, reason panel, and grab handle all use reduced padding on mobile (px-3/py-2.5) while preserving desktop padding (px-4/py-3).

## [1.0.20] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- **AdEditor layout cleanup**: Replaced fixed height container (h-[85dvh]/h-[70vh]) with content-driven max-h sizing so the popup shrinks to fit content. Unified pill selector across all viewports (removed desktop-only chevron navigation). Moved time adjustment controls from sticky top header into desktop bottom bar and mobile bottom sheet. Reason panel no longer stretches with flex-1. Removed sticky positioning since the container no longer needs scroll context. Time controls styled with rounded-md border border-border to match action buttons.

## [1.0.19] - 2026-02-28

### Changed
- **Redesigned ad editor time adjustment controls**: +/- buttons use bg-muted filled style matching the rest of the UI instead of hard-bordered containers. Always visible on all viewports (removed collapsible mobile toggle). Minus/Plus icons, inline "s" suffix, no browser number spinners.
- **Replaced transcript panel with reason panel**: The scrollable transcript view in the ad editor is replaced by an always-visible panel showing why an ad was flagged, its confidence percentage, and detection stage. Removed VTT fetch/parse, touch mode toggles, swipe gestures, and segment click handlers.
- **Renamed TranscriptEditor to AdEditor**: Component, file, props interface, and all references updated to reflect its actual purpose as an ad review/correction editor.

## [1.0.18] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **MinusPod logo in UI**: Header and login page now display the MinusPod logo (audio waveform bars with strike-through and wordmark) instead of plain text, with theme-aware light/dark variants
- **New favicon**: Replaced generic microphone icon with the MinusPod waveform icon extracted from the logo
- **README logo**: Added centered MinusPod logo at the top of README.md

## [1.0.17] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Thread safety for per-episode token accumulator**: Replaced shared module-level dict with `threading.local()` so each thread (background processor, HTTP handler) gets an independent accumulator. Prevents concurrent requests from corrupting each other's token counts under Gunicorn's `--threads 8`.
- **Missing try/finally for token tracking in standalone API endpoints**: `/regenerate-chapters` and `/retry-ad-detection` now wrap LLM calls in `try/finally` so `get_episode_token_totals()` and DB persistence always run even if the LLM call raises.

## [1.0.16] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Standalone API endpoints not tracking per-episode token usage**: `/regenerate-chapters` and `/retry-ad-detection` make LLM calls outside the processing pipeline without activating the per-episode token accumulator. Global `token_usage` table recorded these calls, but they were invisible in per-episode cost display. Both endpoints now activate `start_episode_token_tracking()` before LLM calls and persist totals via `increment_episode_token_usage()`.

### Added
- **`increment_episode_token_usage()` database method**: Increments `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, and `llm_cost` on the most recent completed `processing_history` entry for an episode. Used by standalone endpoints that make LLM calls after the initial processing run.

## [1.0.15] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Processing history not saved due to SQL column mismatch**: `record_processing_history()` INSERT had 14 columns but only 13 VALUES placeholders -- the `?` for `llm_cost` was missing. All processing runs since v1.0.12 silently failed to write history rows (caught by try/except, logged as "Failed to record history: 13 values for 14 columns"). Token accumulator was working correctly but data was discarded at the DB write step.

## [1.0.14] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Always show LLM cost on episode detail page**: Previously hidden when tokens were zero (all pre-feature episodes). Now displays `LLM: $0.00 (0 in / 0 out)` for any completed episode with a processing_history entry.
- **2-digit cost precision in UI**: Changed LLM cost display from 4 decimal places to 2 in both episode detail and history pages for cleaner presentation.

### Added
- **Diagnostic logging for token accumulator lifecycle**: Added logging at accumulator activation, each token callback, and totals retrieval in `llm_client.py`. Added token totals logging before DB write in `main.py` for both success and failure paths. Enables verification via Loki after next processing run.

## [1.0.13] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed
- **Episode detail LLM cost placement**: Moved LLM cost/token display from inside the "Detected Ads" card (hidden when 0 ads found) to the episode metadata bar alongside date, duration, and status badges. Now visible on any processed episode regardless of ad count.
- **Episode token display suppressed when cost is zero**: `_get_episode_token_fields` was checking `llm_cost == 0.0` to hide the display, but models without pricing entries have $0 cost with non-zero tokens. Now checks for zero tokens instead.
- **Missing pricing for `claude-sonnet-4-6`**: Added to `DEFAULT_MODEL_PRICING` ($3/$15 per MTok). Previously all calls to this model recorded $0 cost.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Per-episode LLM token usage and cost tracking**: Every processing run now records input/output token counts and estimated cost directly in `processing_history`. Module-level accumulator in `llm_client.py` aggregates all LLM calls during a single episode's processing pipeline (ad detection, verification, chapters) and passes totals to `record_processing_history()` on completion or failure.
- **Episode detail LLM cost display**: Episode detail page shows LLM cost and token breakdown (e.g. "LLM: $0.0034 (12.3K in / 1.5K out)") when cost data is available.
- **History page cost column**: New sortable "Cost" column in the processing history table shows per-episode LLM cost. Stats summary includes a "Total LLM Cost" tile.
- **Token data in API responses**: `GET /api/v1/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{id}` includes `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `llmCost`. History list, stats, and export endpoints include the same fields.
- **Database migration**: Adds `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `llm_cost` columns to `processing_history` table with zero defaults for backward compatibility.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **LLM token usage tracking with cost calculation**: Every LLM API call (ad detection, verification, chapters) now records input/output token counts and estimated cost. Tracks per-model breakdown in `token_usage` table with pricing from `model_pricing` table seeded with current Anthropic rates. Usage callback wired into `LLMClient` base class so all call sites are tracked automatically with zero code changes.
- **New API endpoint `GET /api/v1/system/token-usage`**: Returns global totals (input/output tokens, total cost) and per-model breakdown with pricing info.
- **LLM Tokens and LLM Cost tiles in System Status**: Settings page now shows cumulative token usage (formatted as "1.2M in / 456K out") and total USD cost alongside existing stats.
- **Model pricing refresh on `GET /settings/models`**: Newly discovered models are automatically priced from built-in defaults when the model list is fetched.
- **New API endpoint `GET /api/v1/system/model-pricing`**: Returns all known model pricing rates from the `model_pricing` table for API consumers.
- **Pricing enrichment on `GET /settings/models`**: Model list response now includes `inputCostPerMtok` and `outputCostPerMtok` fields when pricing is known.
- **Cost display in model dropdowns**: Settings page model selectors show per-token pricing inline (e.g. "Claude Haiku 4.5 ($1 / $5 per MTok)").

## [1.0.10] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- **Age limit on auto-retry for failed queue items**: `reset_failed_queue_items()` now skips items older than 48 hours (configurable via `max_age_hours`). Previously, ancient failed items with elapsed backoff timers were retried on first run, causing 8 stale episodes to be reprocessed on v1.0.9 deploy.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- **Auto-retry for failed queue items in background_queue_processor**: Failed auto-process queue items are now automatically retried with exponential backoff (5/15/45 min). Previously, failed episodes were only retried when a podcast client happened to request them. Respects `MAX_EPISODE_RETRIES` limit and skips permanently failed episodes.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-02-21

### Changed
- **Tightened "WHAT IS NOT AN AD" host mention rule**: Added "organically" qualifier and conversational context to the host self-promotion exclusion in both system and verification prompts, preventing produced cross-promos from being incorrectly excluded
- **Removed blanket network cross-promo exclusion from verification prompt**: The rule "Cross-promotion of shows within the same podcast network (unless it includes promo codes or external URLs)" was too broad and caused produced promo segments to be missed

### Added
- **"PLATFORM-INSERTED ADS" section in both prompts**: New detection guidance for hosting platform pre/post-rolls (Acast, Spotify for Podcasters, iHeart Radio), cross-promotions for other podcasts, and network promos with clear distinction between organic host mentions and produced promotional segments
- **DB migration to auto-update default prompts on existing installs**: Migration uses `PLATFORM-INSERTED ADS` sentinel to detect old prompts and only updates if `is_default` is set (custom prompts are preserved)

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-19

### Security
- **SSRF protection for outbound requests**: User-supplied feed URLs (via `add_feed` and `import_opml`) and second-order URLs from RSS content (artwork, audio) are now validated before any outbound request. Blocks private/reserved IPs, loopback, link-local, cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254, 168.63.129.16), restricted schemes (only http/https allowed), and non-standard ports. Validation applied at API entry points and as defense-in-depth in `rss_parser.py`, `storage.py`, and `transcriber.py`.
- **Stored XSS fix in search snippets**: FTS5 search snippets containing unsanitized RSS description HTML are now sanitized server-side via `nh3` (only `<mark>` tags preserved). Frontend `Search.tsx` replaced unsafe innerHTML rendering with a safe React rendering helper that splits on `<mark>` boundaries and renders all other content as escaped text.

### Added
- `src/utils/url.py` -- SSRF URL validation module (`validate_url`, `SSRFError`)
- `ALLOWED_URL_SCHEMES` and `ALLOWED_URL_PORTS` constants in `src/utils/constants.py`
- `nh3` dependency for HTML sanitization

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **`parse_timestamp` silently returning 0.0 on bad input**: Restored `ValueError` on unparseable timestamps (regression from v1.0.3 consolidation). All 7 callers with `try/except ValueError` were effectively dead code; garbage timestamps silently became 0.0 (episode start), creating false markers at time zero.
- **Permanent LLM errors retried indefinitely**: Added early `return False` in `is_retryable_error()` for non-retryable Anthropic/OpenAI status codes, preventing fallthrough to string-pattern matching. Added `is_llm_api_error()` helper and guard in `is_transient_error()` so permanent API errors (e.g. `BadRequestError`, `AuthenticationError`) are not misclassified as transient.
- **Stale schema comment on `pattern_corrections` table**: Updated from "audit log ... never deleted" to reflect that conflicting entries are cleaned up on reversal (v1.0.5 behavior).

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **Conflicting corrections not cleaned up on user action reversal**: When a user changed their mind about a correction (e.g., marked false positive then confirmed, or vice versa), both corrections persisted in the database. The false_positive check has higher priority in validation, so a confirm could never override a prior false_positive for the same segment. Now `delete_conflicting_corrections()` removes the opposite correction type (with 50% overlap match) before inserting the new one.
- **Misleading flag prefix in ad_validator.py**: Changed "ERROR: User marked as false positive" to "INFO:" since this is an intentional user action, not an error condition.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **ChaptersGenerator `self.client` AttributeError**: Replaced 4 remaining references to the removed `client` backward-compat property with `self._llm_client` (the actual backing field). Regression introduced in v1.0.3 Phase D item 21 when backward-compatibility aliases were removed.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-18

### Changed (Code Simplification)

- **Consolidated duplicate `parse_timestamp` implementations**: Merged 3 separate versions (utils/time.py, ad_detector.py, chapters_generator.py) into a single canonical version in `utils/time.py` that handles all input types (int, float, string with 's' suffix, HH:MM:SS, MM:SS, VTT comma decimals).
- **Consolidated duplicate `adjust_timestamp` implementations**: Merged transcript_generator.py and chapters_generator.py versions into `utils/time.py`. Both modules now import the shared function.
- **Consolidated duplicate `format_vtt_timestamp`**: Merged transcriber.py and transcript_generator.py versions into `utils/time.py` (HH:MM:SS.mmm format).
- **Consolidated `FALLBACK_MODELS` list**: Defined once in `llm_client.py` at module level, replacing 3 identical lists in AnthropicClient, OpenAICompatibleClient, and AdDetector.
- **Simplified `is_transient_error` in main.py**: Now delegates LLM API error classification to `llm_client.is_retryable_error()` instead of duplicating the logic.
- **Moved `first_not_none` to utils/time.py**: Extracted from ad_detector.py for reuse; critical for preserving 0.0 pre-roll timestamps.
- **Consolidated FFPROBE_TIMEOUT**: utils/audio.py now imports from config.py instead of defining its own copy.
- **Consolidated User-Agent strings**: Added `BROWSER_USER_AGENT` and `APP_USER_AGENT` constants to config.py; updated storage.py, rss_parser.py, and transcriber.py.
- **Decomposed `process_episode()` (~640 lines)**: Extracted 7 named pipeline stage functions (`_download_and_transcribe`, `_run_audio_analysis`, `_detect_ads_first_pass`, `_refine_and_validate`, `_run_verification_pass`, `_generate_assets`, `_finalize_episode`) plus `_handle_processing_failure`. The orchestrator is now ~70 lines.
- **Extracted `_extract_json_ads_array()` from `_parse_ads_from_response()`**: 4 JSON extraction strategies (direct parse, markdown code block, regex scan, bracket fallback) now in a dedicated method.
- **Simplified `_run_schema_migrations()` (~590 lines -> ~120 lines)**: Added `_add_column_if_missing()`, `_rename_column_if_needed()`, and `_get_table_columns()` helpers. All 25+ repetitive ALTER TABLE blocks replaced with data-driven lists.
- **Updated hardcoded model in chapters_generator.py**: Replaced `"claude-3-5-haiku-20241022"` with configurable `CHAPTERS_MODEL` constant set to `"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001"`.
- **Merged identical `complete_job()`/`fail_job()` in status_service.py**: Both now delegate to shared `_clear_current_job()`.
- **Extracted common overlap check in ad_validator.py**: `_overlaps_false_positive()` and `_overlaps_confirmed()` now delegate to parameterized `_overlaps_corrections()`.
- **Fixed overly broad auth path exemptions in api.py**: Changed `/rss` substring check to `path.endswith('/rss')` and scoped `/audio` and `/artwork` checks to `/api/v1/feeds/` prefix.
- **Moved inline stdlib imports to module level**: `import re` and `import math` in api.py, `import time` in database.py.
- **Added `transaction()` context manager to Database**: Provides `with db.transaction() as conn:` for automatic commit/rollback.
- **Removed backward-compatibility aliases**: `get_podcast()` in database.py, `client` properties in ad_detector.py and chapters_generator.py.
- **Removed unnecessary ImportError guards**: Local module imports in ad_detector.py lazy properties (audio_fingerprinter, text_pattern_matcher, pattern_service, sponsor_service) no longer wrapped in try/except ImportError.
- **Added VTT parse failure logging**: transcript_generator.py now warns when VTT parsing returns empty segments.
- **Removed `parse_timestamp_to_seconds()` wrapper**: chapters_generator.py callers now use `parse_timestamp()` directly from utils.time.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **Missed tagline-style DAI ads**: Added detection guidance for short (15-45s) brand tagline
  ads that lack promo codes or URLs -- polished radio-commercial-style spots with concentrated
  marketing language. Added synthetic example to prompt and GNC to brand list. DB migration
  auto-updates default prompts (preserves user customizations).
- **Claude timestamp hallucination**: New `validate_ad_timestamps()` checks whether ad keywords
  actually appear at the reported transcript position. If not, searches the window for the
  correct location and corrects the timestamps before downstream filtering.
- **Pattern-overlap filtering silently dropping uncovered tails**: Replaced binary
  `_is_region_covered()` with `get_uncovered_portions()` in the Claude/pattern merge loop.
  Uncovered portions >= 15s are now preserved as separate ad segments instead of being
  discarded when a pattern covers >50% of a merged Claude ad.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **Rejected ad not restored after user confirmation**: Four cascading bugs prevented
  user "Confirm as Ad" corrections from taking effect on reprocess.
  - `NOT_AD_PATTERNS` regex false positive: "transition from show content" in ad reasons
    incorrectly triggered rejection. Replaced negative lookbehind with positive assertion.
  - Confirmed corrections ignored during reprocessing: Added `get_confirmed_corrections()`
    to database and `_overlaps_confirmed()` to validator. Confirmed ads now force-accept
    at confidence 1.0 (priority: false_positive REJECT > confirmed ACCEPT > normal).
  - Frontend omitted `sponsor` field from correction payload, preventing sponsor
    extraction on the backend.
  - Confirm handler sponsor extraction used adjusted timestamps against original
    timestamps. Added reason-text fallback before transcript-based extraction.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-14

Major release: pipeline redesign, MinusPod rebrand, and ad detection overhaul.

### Changed
- **Renamed to MinusPod**: Service name, Docker image (`ttlequals0/minuspod`), frontend title, package name, API docs, README, and deployment docs all updated from "Podcast Server" / "podcast-server".
- **Replaced two-pass architecture with verification pipeline**: The blind second pass is replaced by a post-cut verification pass that re-transcribes processed audio and runs detection with a "what doesn't belong" prompt. Missed ads are re-cut directly from pass 1 output.
- **Audio signals as Claude prompt context**: Volume anomalies and DAI transition pairs are formatted as text and injected into Claude's per-window prompts instead of running as an independent post-detection step. Claude makes all ad/not-ad decisions with full audio evidence.
- **Audio analysis always enabled**: Removed global `audioAnalysisEnabled` toggle and per-feed `audioAnalysisOverride`. Volume analysis via ffmpeg is lightweight and always runs.
- **AdMarker schema updated**: `pass` field replaced with `detection_stage` enum covering first_pass, claude, fingerprint, text_pattern, language, audio_enforced, and verification stages.
- **Confidence slider is single source of truth**: Removed hardcoded dual-thresholds that bypassed the user's min_cut_confidence slider. ACCEPT = always cut, REJECT = never cut, REVIEW = confidence gate.
- **Detection prompts rewritten**: Removed "when in doubt, mark it as an ad" bias. Both passes require identifiable promotional language. Added "WHAT IS NOT AN AD" guidance and "AUDIO SIGNALS" evidence-only framing.
- **Transition detection threshold raised from 3.5 dB to 12.0 dB**: Added delta-ratio symmetry filter and recalibrated confidence formula to eliminate false positives from normal audio variation.
- **Pattern learning quality gates**: Only creates patterns from ads that were actually cut. Sponsor extraction uses 4-tier DB resolution with prefix and short-word rejection gates.

### Added
- **Abrupt transition detection**: New `TransitionDetector` analyzes frame-to-frame loudness jumps in existing volume analyzer output. Pairs up/down transitions into candidate DAI regions.
- **Audio signal enforcement**: New `AudioEnforcer` formats audio signals for Claude prompts and extends existing ad boundaries when signals partially overlap.
- **Verification pass module**: New `VerificationPass` class encapsulates the full post-cut pipeline with separate model selection.
- **Heuristic pre/post-roll detection**: New `roll_detector.py` with regex-based detection for ads at episode boundaries that Claude missed. Requires 2+ pattern matches.
- **Transcript generation**: New `TranscriptGenerator` produces timestamp-aligned text stored in the database for search indexing and UI display.
- **Silent-gap ad merge**: Consecutive ads separated by up to 30s of silence (no speech) are merged into a single ad instead of requiring 5s proximity.
- **Incremental search index updates**: Episodes indexed immediately after processing; full rebuild every 6 hours.
- **VTT-based transcript timestamps in UI**: EpisodeDetail fetches actual VTT transcript for accurate timestamps instead of approximating.
- **Sponsor field on ad markers**: Ad markers now store the `sponsor` field separately for UI sponsor badges. Window deduplication preserves sponsor names during merges.

### Fixed
- **Pre-roll ads at 0.0s silently dropped**: Python `or`-chains treated `0.0` as falsy; replaced with `_first_not_none()` helper.
- **Pass 2 ads missing from UI and showing wrong timestamps**: Multiple fixes for verification ads not being saved or displaying with processed-audio timestamps instead of original coordinates.
- **Ad marker reasons showing bare sponsor names**: Three independent merge/dedup bugs caused markers to display unhelpful reasons instead of descriptive text.
- **Corrupt fingerprints causing stuck episodes**: Auto-detection and deletion of broken fingerprints; bail-out when all fingerprints are corrupt.
- **CTranslate2 cuDNN crash**: Added `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for nvidia pip package directories.
- **Content segments parsed as ads**: Dynamic ad-evidence validation requires positive proof (known sponsor, ad-language patterns, or explicit sponsor field).

### Removed
- **Speaker diarization and music bed detection**: Dropped pyannote.audio and librosa dependencies. GPU memory pressure, processing time, and heavy dependencies for marginal benefit.
- **Dependencies**: `librosa`, `pyannote.audio`, `nvidia-cudnn-cu12` (re-added then managed via LD_LIBRARY_PATH).
- **Dead code**: Unused functions, blind second pass prompt, stale UI text, audio analysis toggle settings.

## [0.1.258] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Missing sponsor names and raw detection_stage in UI**: Claude-detected ads now store the `sponsor` field separately (extracted via `extract_sponsor_name`) so the UI can display sponsor badges. Window deduplication preserves sponsor names during merges. Frontend passes through `marker.sponsor` from the API instead of hardcoding `undefined`. TranscriptEditor maps raw `detection_stage` values to human-friendly labels (Pass 1, Pass 2, Fingerprint, Pattern, Language) instead of showing "claude" or "text_pattern".

## [0.1.257] - 2026-02-14

### Fixed
- **Ad marker reasons show bare sponsor names instead of descriptions**: Three independent bugs caused ad markers to display unhelpful reasons like "Ironclad" or "Contains" instead of descriptive text. (1) Cross-stage merge in `_merge_detection_results` never updated the `reason` field when merging overlapping ads from different detection stages -- now picks the longer (more descriptive) reason. (2) Window deduplication in `deduplicate_window_ads` replaced reason based solely on confidence -- now keeps the more descriptive reason regardless of which window had higher confidence. (3) Claude reason extraction preferred `extract_sponsor_name` (bare name) over Claude's raw `reason` field -- now falls back to Claude's reason when it is substantially more descriptive than the bare sponsor name.

## [0.1.256] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Silent-gap ad merge** (Phase 18): Consecutive ads separated by up to 30s of silence (no speech) are now merged into a single ad. Previously only ads within 5s were merged, leaving fragmented detections when an ad break contained a brief silence between sponsors. New `_has_speech_in_range()` method checks transcript segments to distinguish silent gaps from content. `MAX_SILENT_GAP` constant (30s) added to config.
- **Incremental search index updates** (Phase 19): New `index_episode()` method indexes a single episode immediately after processing, so it appears in search results without waiting for a full rebuild. Periodic full rebuild runs every 6 hours via `run_cleanup()`.
- **VTT-based transcript timestamps in UI** (Phase 20): EpisodeDetail now fetches and parses the actual VTT transcript file for accurate timestamps instead of approximating by evenly distributing text across the episode duration. Falls back to the old approximation when VTT is unavailable.
- **Processed transcript text storage** (Phase 20): New `generate_text()` method on TranscriptGenerator produces a `[HH:MM:SS.sss --> HH:MM:SS.sss] text` format stored in the database after processing. This is the ad-free, timestamp-adjusted transcript used by search indexing.

### Changed
- **Renamed to MinusPod** (Phase 22): Service name, Docker image, frontend title, package name, API docs title, README heading, and deployment docs all updated from "Podcast Server" / "podcast-server" to "MinusPod" / "minuspod".
- **Pass label text in UI** (Phase 20): Detection stage labels changed from "first pass" / "verification" to "pass 1" / "pass 2" for consistency.

### Fixed
- **Fingerprint scan wastes iterations when all fingerprints are broken** (Phase 17): When every known fingerprint in the database is corrupt, the sliding window loop still iterated through the entire audio file doing ffmpeg+fpcalc work for nothing. Added a bail-out check that breaks immediately when all known fingerprints are in the broken set.

### Removed
- **Dead code cleanup** (Phase 21): Removed three unused functions: `extract_url_sponsor()` from ad_detector.py, `extract_segments_with_timestamps()` from utils/text.py, `format_time_simple()` from utils/time.py.

## [0.1.255] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **v0.1.254 fix missed ctypes.ArgumentError**: The corrupt fingerprint exception is `ctypes.ArgumentError` (from the C library binding), not Python's `TypeError`. The `<class 'TypeError'>` in the error message was the ctypes description of the type mismatch, not the exception class. Updated the catch to handle both `TypeError` and `ctypes.ArgumentError`.

## [0.1.254] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- **Stuck episode caused by corrupt audio fingerprint in database**: A corrupt fingerprint stored in the database caused `acoustid.chromaprint.decode_fingerprint()` to throw `TypeError` on every comparison. The `find_matches()` sliding window loop (3300 iterations for a 6605s episode) caught and swallowed the error each time, taking ~47 minutes of wasted work -- longer than the 37-minute orphan detector timeout. The episode was killed, reset, and retried in a loop it could never escape. Fix: `compare_fingerprints()` now returns -1.0 for TypeError (distinguishing broken data from no-match), and `find_matches()` tracks broken pattern IDs in a set, skipping them after the first failure. Corrupt fingerprints are auto-deleted from the database. A 47-minute scan of errors becomes 1 warning + fast completion.

## [0.1.253] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Pre-roll ads starting at 0.0s silently dropped**: The LLM response parser used Python `or`-chains to extract start/end timestamps from Claude's JSON response. Since `0.0` is falsy in Python, `0.0 or ad.get('start_time')` would skip the valid value and fall through to `None`, causing the ad to be silently discarded at the `start_val is not None` check. Replaced `or`-chains with `_first_not_none()` helper that correctly treats `0` and `0.0` as valid values. Every pre-roll ad starting at timestamp 0.0 was previously being lost.

## [0.1.252] - 2026-02-12

### Changed
- **Detection prompts updated to reduce false positives** (Phase 16): Removed "when in doubt, mark it as an ad" bias from Pass 1 prompt. Both Pass 1 and Pass 2 prompts now require identifiable promotional language (sponsor names, URLs, promo codes, product pitches, calls to action) to flag an ad. Added "WHAT IS NOT AN AD" section to Pass 1 listing silence/pauses, topic transitions, and audio-only anomalies. Added "AUDIO SIGNALS" section to Pass 1 explicitly stating signals are supporting evidence only. Added CRITICAL paragraph to Pass 2 requiring promotional transcript content. Removed "BE THOROUGH" over-flagging encouragement from Pass 2. Strengthened audio_enforcer.py header to reinforce that audio signals without promotional content are not ads. Addresses SN 1064 false positive where a 2935-2970s silence gap was flagged as an ad at 65% confidence.

## [0.1.251] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Pass 2 heuristic roll ads showing wrong timestamps in UI** (Phase 15.3): Pre/post-roll ads detected by heuristic on processed audio were copied directly into `verification_ads_original` with processed-audio timestamps. Since pass 1 cuts shift the timeline, these timestamps were wrong in the UI. Now maps heuristic roll ad timestamps through `_map_to_original` using the pass 1 cuts, matching how Claude's verification ads are already mapped.

## [0.1.250] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Heuristic pre/post-roll detection** (Phase 15): New `roll_detector.py` with regex-based detection for ads at episode boundaries that Claude missed due to LLM nondeterminism. Detects ad indicators (URLs, phone numbers, CTAs, promo codes) before show intro (pre-roll) and after sign-off (post-roll). Requires 2+ pattern matches with conservative confidence (0.80-0.95). Runs in both Pass 1 and Pass 2.

### Changed
- **Confidence slider is now the single source of truth** (Phase 11): AdValidator's `_make_decision` no longer has hardcoded 0.85/0.60 dual-thresholds that bypassed the user's min_cut_confidence slider. The ACCEPT/REVIEW boundary now uses the slider value (default 80%). Ads between REJECT_CONFIDENCE and the slider correctly get REVIEW instead of being silently auto-accepted. Removed `HIGH_CONFIDENCE` constant from config.py.
- **Pattern learning quality gates** (Phase 10): `_learn_from_detections` now only creates patterns from ads that were actually cut (`was_cut=True`). Sponsor extraction uses 4-tier DB resolution (DB lookup on sponsor field, DB lookup on reason text, regex extraction, raw sponsor fallback) with two rejection gates: prefix check (rejects "Capital" when "Capital One" exists in DB) and short-word check for unknown sponsors. Removed space-stripping from `_extract_sponsor_from_reason` that corrupted multi-word names.
- **Pattern learning moved from ad_detector to main.py**: `_learn_from_detections` call moved to after validation sets `was_cut`, so the `was_cut` gate works correctly.
- **Episode duration from audio file** (Phase 14): `episode_duration` now uses `audio_processor.get_audio_duration()` instead of `segments[-1]['end']`. Fixes trailing ads not being extended when audio file is longer than last transcribed word (Whisper stops at speech end, missing trailing silence/music/jingle).

### Fixed
- **Reason fallback logic** (Phase 9): `extract_sponsor_name()` is now tried first; only falls back to Claude's raw reason field if it returns the default "Advertisement detected". Previously the raw reason was checked first but rejected valid values like "mid-roll" or "host read" that appeared in `INVALID_SPONSOR_VALUES`.
- **Pass 2 ads displayed out of chronological order** (Phase 12): Combined ads list now sorted by start timestamp after appending pass 2 verification ads.
- **Pass 2 status showing "Verifying" instead of substages** (Phase 13): Changed verification detection callback from `verifying:N/M` to `detecting:N/M` so the UI shows "Pass 2: Detecting ads" instead of overwriting substage labels. Removed premature `pass2:verifying` status update. Cleaned up `pass2:verifying` label from frontend status bar.

## [0.1.249] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Pass 2 ads missing from UI**: `save_combined_ads` was called only with pass 1 ads. Pass 2 verification ads (`v_ads_for_ui`) were cut from audio but never appended to the stored ad markers, so they didn't appear in the UI or API response. Now re-saves combined ads after verification adds its ads.
- **Pass 2 status stuck on "Verifying"**: Verification pass only reported status during Claude detection (via progress callback), but transcription and audio analysis stages had no status updates. Added `progress_callback` calls for transcribing and analyzing steps inside `VerificationPass.verify()`, so the UI now shows "Pass 2: Transcribing", "Pass 2: Analyzing audio", "Pass 2: Detecting ads" progression.

## [0.1.248] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- **Transition detection threshold raised from 3.5 dB to 12.0 dB**: The old threshold caught normal audio variation as DAI splices. Real DAI ad insertions produce 12+ dB jumps. Added delta-ratio symmetry filter (< 0.5 rejected) and recalibrated confidence formula.
- **Audio enforcer converted from independent actor to prompt formatter**: The old enforcer pattern-matched transcript text independently of Claude and created phantom ads. New `AudioEnforcer.format_for_window()` formats audio signals as text context injected into Claude's per-window prompts so Claude makes all ad/not-ad decisions with full audio evidence.
- **Audio signals now included in Claude's detection prompts**: Both pass 1 (`detect_ads`) and pass 2 (`run_verification_detection`) inject DAI transition pairs and volume anomalies into each window's prompt via the audio enforcer formatter.
- **Verification pass returns dual timestamps**: Pass 2 now maps processed-audio timestamps back to original-audio coordinates. `ads` (original timestamps) used for UI/DB display, `ads_processed` (processed timestamps) used for FFMPEG cutting. Fixes timestamp mismatch where pass 2 ads showed wrong positions in the UI.
- **Frontend status display shows pass 1/pass 2 stages**: Status bar labels prefixed with "Pass 1:" and "Pass 2:" for clarity. `getStageLabel()` function handles substage parsing (e.g., `pass1:detecting:2/5`). Detection stage badges renamed from "First Pass"/"Audio Enforced"/"Verification" to "Pass 1"/"Pass 2".

### Removed
- **Whisper model unload before audio analysis**: Audio analysis is CPU-only, so unloading the GPU model before it was unnecessary and wasted 10-15s on reload for the verification pass.
- **Audio enforcer post-detection step**: The independent enforcement step in main.py that created ads from uncovered audio signals has been removed. Audio signals now flow through Claude's prompt instead.
- **`DAI_CONFIDENCE_ONLY_THRESHOLD` config constant**: No longer needed since the enforcer no longer creates ads independently.

### Fixed
- **Verification pass `_transcribe_on_gpu` double exception handling**: The inner try/except caught all exceptions and returned `[]`, preventing the outer catch from ever setting `'transcription_failed'` status. Removed inner try/except so exceptions propagate to the caller.
- **Anthropic SDK pinned version**: Unpinned `anthropic==0.49.0` to `anthropic>=0.49.0` to allow compatible updates.

## [0.1.247] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Verification pass uses GPU instead of CPU**: Verification transcription was creating a fresh CPU model (20-30x slower) instead of reusing the GPU singleton. Now calls `WhisperModelSingleton.get_instance()` which lazy-reloads the GPU model after it was freed for audio analysis. ~30-min episodes go from 15-30 min to ~1-2 min for verification transcription.
- **ACCEPT decisions now always cut**: Validator ACCEPT (confidence >= 0.60) and the cutting filter (MIN_CUT_CONFIDENCE = 0.80) were contradictory -- ads with 0.60-0.79 confidence were ACCEPTed then not cut. Now ACCEPT = always cut, REJECT = never cut, REVIEW = confidence gate. This prevents validated ads like sponsor reads from being silently kept in audio.
- **AudioEnforcer false positives from confidence-only path**: DAI transition pairs with confidence >= 0.80 could create ads without any ad language in the transcript, causing false positives when strong audio transitions occurred during normal show content. Raised threshold from 0.80 to 0.95 (`DAI_CONFIDENCE_ONLY_THRESHOLD`). Ads with ad language in transcript are unaffected.
- **Mid-roll position boost gaps**: Position windows had dead zones (0.35-0.45, 0.55-0.65) where ads received no position boost. Simplified from three narrow windows (`MID_ROLL_1/2/3`) to a single continuous range (0.15-0.85) so all mid-roll ads get the +0.05 confidence boost.

## [0.1.246] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **CTranslate2 cuDNN crash (SIGABRT code 134)**: The nvidia-cudnn-cu12 pip package installs `.so` files into Python's site-packages (`nvidia/cudnn/lib/`), but CTranslate2 uses `dlopen()` which only searches `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and system paths. Added `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to Dockerfile ENV pointing to the nvidia pip package lib directories. Removed redundant `nvidia-cudnn-cu12` from requirements.txt (already a dependency of torch).

## [0.1.245] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Restore nvidia-cudnn-cu12 dependency**: CTranslate2 (faster-whisper GPU backend) requires cuDNN for CUDA inference. Removal in v0.1.242 caused worker SIGABRT crashes during transcription. Re-added `nvidia-cudnn-cu12==8.9.2.26`.
- **Pattern backfill crash**: `extract_transcript_segment` was called in `database.py` but never imported. Replaced with already-imported `extract_text_in_range` (identical behavior).
- **Stuck episode reset killing active jobs**: `reset_stuck_processing_episodes()` ran on every Gunicorn worker boot and reset ALL processing episodes with no time check. A worker restart during active transcription would kill the in-progress job. Added 30-minute guard so only genuinely stuck episodes are reset.
- **Orphaned queue state blocking reprocessing**: When a worker crashes (SIGABRT), the flock is released by the OS but the state file still says "processing". `_clear_stale_state()` only checked the 60-minute timeout, so any reprocess attempt got "already_processing" for up to an hour. Now probes the flock to detect orphaned state immediately -- if no process holds the lock, the state is cleared regardless of elapsed time.

## [0.1.244] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Detailed verification prompt**: Replaced simplified verification pass prompt with full version including fragment detection (highest priority), missed ad patterns, "how to identify fragments" guidance, ad boundary rules, and three concrete examples (fragment, missed ad, clean episode).
- **First pass prompt improvement**: Added "dynamically inserted ads" detection line to first pass prompt WHAT TO LOOK FOR section.

### Removed
- **Dead second pass prompt**: Removed unused `DEFAULT_SECOND_PASS_PROMPT` constant (blind second pass was replaced by verification pipeline in v0.1.242).
- **Stale UI text**: Removed "Can be skipped per-podcast" from verification pass Settings description (no longer applicable).

## [0.1.243] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Pin numpy<2.0 for CPU compatibility**: numpy 2.x requires X86_V2 CPU instructions which the target server lacks, causing a RuntimeError on startup via ctranslate2 import. Pinning numpy<2.0 resolves the crash introduced when the huggingface_hub upper pin was removed (pyannote constraint gone).

## [0.1.242] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Replaced two-pass architecture with verification pipeline**: The blind second pass (re-analyzing the same transcript with a different prompt) is replaced by a post-cut verification pass that re-transcribes the processed audio on CPU and runs full detection with a "what doesn't belong" prompt. If missed ads are found, the pass 1 output is re-cut directly. No timestamp mapping needed since verification operates entirely in processed-audio coordinates.
- **Removed audio context injection from Claude's prompt**: Audio signals (volume anomalies, transitions) were previously formatted as text and injected into Claude's sliding window prompt. This indirect approach is replaced by programmatic audio enforcement (see below) that acts as a post-Claude step.
- **Removed speaker diarization and music bed detection**: Dropped pyannote.audio and librosa dependencies entirely. Speaker analysis and music detection added GPU memory pressure, processing time, and heavy dependencies (nvidia-cudnn-cu12, HF_TOKEN auth) for marginal benefit. Audio analysis now runs volume analysis only (ffmpeg ebur128, zero extra dependencies) plus the new transition detector.
- **Audio analysis always enabled**: Removed the global `audioAnalysisEnabled` toggle and per-feed `audioAnalysisOverride` settings. Volume analysis via ffmpeg is lightweight and always runs.
- **Settings renamed**: `secondPassPrompt` -> `verificationPrompt`, `secondPassModel` -> `verificationModel`. Old settings are automatically migrated. `multiPassEnabled` toggle removed (verification always runs).
- **AdMarker schema updated**: `pass` field (1, 2, "merged") replaced with `detection_stage` enum (`first_pass`, `audio_enforced`, `verification`).

### Added
- **Abrupt transition detection**: New `TransitionDetector` analyzes frame-to-frame loudness jumps in the existing volume analyzer output (zero extra cost). Pairs up/down transitions into candidate DAI (dynamically inserted ad) regions with configurable thresholds (`TRANSITION_THRESHOLD_DB`, `MIN/MAX_TRANSITION_AD_DURATION`).
- **Audio signal enforcement**: New `AudioEnforcer` runs after Claude's first pass to programmatically check whether audio signals overlap with detected ads. Uncovered DAI transition pairs with ad language in the transcript (or high confidence >= 0.8, or sponsor match) become new ads. Volume anomalies require both ad language AND sponsor match (higher bar). Existing ads are extended up to 30s when a signal partially overlaps their boundaries.
- **Verification pass module**: New `VerificationPass` class encapsulates the full post-cut pipeline: CPU re-transcription (using faster_whisper directly, not WhisperModelSingleton), audio analysis on processed audio, Claude detection with verification prompt/model, audio enforcement, and ad validation.
- **Separate verification model setting**: The verification pass can use a different Claude model from the first pass, configurable in Settings as "Verification Model".

### Removed
- **Dependencies**: `librosa>=0.10.0`, `pyannote.audio>=3.1.0,<4.0.0`, `nvidia-cudnn-cu12==8.9.2.26`. Removed `huggingface_hub` upper version pin (`<1.0` was a pyannote constraint).
- **Files**: `src/audio_analysis/speaker_analyzer.py`, `src/audio_analysis/music_detector.py`.
- **Methods**: `detect_ads_second_pass()`, `is_multi_pass_enabled()`, `get_second_pass_prompt()`, `get_second_pass_model()`, `_format_audio_context()`, `_format_time()`, `format_for_claude()`, `is_enabled_for_podcast()` from AudioAnalyzer.
- **Settings**: `multi_pass_enabled`, `audio_analysis_enabled`, `volume_analysis_enabled`, `music_detection_enabled`, `speaker_analysis_enabled`, `music_confidence_threshold`, `monologue_duration_threshold`.
- **Dataclasses**: `SpeakerSegment`, `ConversationMetrics`. `SignalType.MUSIC_BED`, `MONOLOGUE`, `SPEAKER_CHANGE` enum values.

---

## [0.1.241] - 2026-02-09

### Changed
- **Centralized shared constants into `utils/constants.py`**: Deduplicated `INVALID_SPONSOR_VALUES` (3 definitions across `ad_detector.py` and `text_pattern_matcher.py`), `STRUCTURAL_FIELDS`, `SPONSOR_PRIORITY_FIELDS`, `SPONSOR_PATTERN_KEYWORDS`, `INVALID_SPONSOR_CAPTURE_WORDS`, and `NOT_AD_CLASSIFICATIONS` into a single source of truth. All consumers now import from `utils.constants`.
- **Consolidated `extract_sponsor_from_text()` into `SponsorService`**: Removed 3 identical implementations (module-level in `api.py`, local function in `database.py`, and local function in `ad_detector.py`). `SponsorService.extract_sponsor_from_text()` is now the canonical static method; `api.py` delegates to it, `database.py` uses a lazy import.
- **Extracted `_parse_aliases()` helper in `SponsorService`**: Replaced 3 identical JSON alias-parsing blocks in `get_sponsor_names()`, `find_sponsor_in_text()`, and `get_sponsors_in_text()` with a single `_parse_aliases()` static method.
- **Precompiled sponsor regex patterns in `SponsorService`**: Word-boundary patterns for sponsor matching are now compiled once during `_refresh_cache_if_needed()` and stored as `_compiled_patterns` dict, instead of recompiling per search call.
- **Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`**: Updated all 19 call sites across 7 files (`cleanup_service.py`, `main.py`, `api.py`, `database.py`, `sponsor_service.py`, `pattern_service.py`, `text_pattern_matcher.py`). Removed `.replace(tzinfo=None)` workarounds that were needed for mixed tz-aware/naive comparisons. All timestamp strings stored to DB now use `strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ')` to match SQLite's default format, replacing `.isoformat() + 'Z'` which would have produced malformed `+00:00Z` suffixes with tz-aware datetimes.
- **Replaced hardcoded thresholds with config constants**: Added `CONTENT_DURATION_THRESHOLD` (120s) and `LOW_EVIDENCE_WARN_THRESHOLD` (60s) to `config.py`. Updated `ad_detector.py` to use `LOW_CONFIDENCE`, `CONTENT_DURATION_THRESHOLD`, and `LOW_EVIDENCE_WARN_THRESHOLD` instead of hardcoded `0.5`, `120`, and `60`.
- **Eliminated redundant stale-state checks in `ProcessingQueue`**: `is_processing()` and `is_busy()` no longer call `_clear_stale_state()` directly since `get_current()` already does it.
- **Removed 4 redundant inline `import json` statements in `api.py`**: `json` is already imported at module level.

### Fixed
- **Atomic state file write in `ProcessingQueue`**: `_write_state()` now writes to a `.tmp` file and renames atomically, preventing corrupt state if the process crashes or OOMs mid-write.
- **Strategy 3 JSON parse unhandled exception**: `ad_detector.py` Strategy 3 (bracket fallback) `json.loads()` was not wrapped in try/except unlike Strategies 1-2. Now catches `json.JSONDecodeError` with diagnostic logging (content length, first/last chars).
- **5 bare `except:` clauses replaced with specific types**: `api.py` (json/type/key errors), `main.py` x2 (value/type errors), `transcriber.py` x2 (OS errors for file cleanup).

### Added
- **Updated OpenAPI spec from 0.1.184 to current**: Added 16 missing endpoint definitions (OPML import, batch reprocess, sponsor CRUD, normalization CRUD, pattern stats/health/merge, search endpoints, queue clear, prompts reset). Updated 3 existing sponsor/normalization endpoints to reflect the new SponsorService CRUD API. Added `Sponsor`, `Normalization`, and `SearchResult` schemas. Version is now served dynamically from `version.py` at runtime.
- **Wired up pattern learning pipeline**: 4 functions (260 lines) that were part of the designed pattern learning system but had zero callers are now connected:
  - `merge_similar_patterns()`: Called from `promote_pattern()` after promotion to consolidate similar patterns at the new scope level.
  - `check_sponsor_global_promotion()` and `auto_promote_sponsor_patterns()`: Called from `record_pattern_match()` when a sponsor hits the global threshold (3+ podcasts).
  - `store_fingerprint()`: Called from `_learn_from_detections()` after creating a text pattern, to also store the audio fingerprint for the same segment.

---

## [0.1.240] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- **Low-confidence segments without sponsor evidence accepted as ads**: Added a confidence gate (< 50%) before the existing duration gate in dynamic validation. Segments with no sponsor field, no known sponsor match, and no ad-language patterns are now rejected if confidence is below 50%, regardless of duration. Previously, short segments (< 120s) with confidence as low as 30-40% would pass through even when Claude's own reason described them as non-ads.
- **False positive sponsor matches from substring collision**: `find_sponsor_in_text()` and `get_sponsors_in_text()` used naive `in` substring matching, so short sponsor names or aliases (e.g., "cam") could match inside unrelated words (e.g., "Cam Newton"). Both functions now use `re.search()` with word boundaries (`\b`). Names and aliases shorter than 3 characters are skipped entirely to prevent false positives.
- **`was_cut=false` ads displayed alongside actually-removed ads in UI**: The API endpoint separated ad markers only by validator decision (REJECT vs everything else), so low-confidence REVIEW ads with `was_cut=false` appeared in `adMarkers` next to real removed ads. The separation logic now also checks `was_cut`: any ad with `was_cut=false` goes into `rejectedAdMarkers` regardless of validation decision.

---

## [0.1.239] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Content segments parsed as ads when LLM returns descriptive reasons without sponsor info**: Added dynamic ad-evidence validation in `_parse_ads_from_response()` that requires positive proof a segment is an ad (known sponsor in database, ad-language patterns, or explicit sponsor field) before accepting it. Segments >= 120s with no evidence are rejected; 60-120s segments log a warning. This replaces the whack-a-mole approach of growing blocklists with every new LLM output variation. The check is database-driven via `SponsorService.find_sponsor_in_text()` so new sponsors added via API automatically work without code changes.
- **Confidence values displayed as 10000% in UI**: When Claude returns confidence as a percentage (e.g., `100.0` instead of `1.0`), the parser now normalizes to 0-1 range by dividing values > 1.0 by 100, then clamping to [0.0, 1.0].

---

## [0.1.238] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Incorrect model IDs in fallback lists**: Fixed `claude-opus-4-1-20250414` to correct date suffix `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`. Removed `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` which is no longer in the Anthropic catalog. Added missing `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (Haiku 4.5) and `claude-opus-4-20250514` (legacy Opus 4) to all three fallback lists: `AnthropicClient._get_fallback_models()`, `OpenAICompatibleClient._get_fallback_models()`, and `AdDetector.get_available_models()`. Also added `claude-opus-4-1-20250805` and `claude-opus-4-20250514` to the `ad_detector.py` fallback which was missing them entirely.

---

## [0.1.237] - 2026-02-07

### Added
- **Dynamic sponsor injection into Claude prompts**: `SponsorService.get_claude_sponsor_list()` existed but was never called. System and second-pass prompts now append a "DYNAMIC SPONSOR DATABASE" section at detection time with all known sponsors from the database. This supplements the hardcoded seed list without modifying the stored/customizable prompt text. Sponsors added via API or discovered during processing now actually influence future detections.
- **Podcast-specific sponsor history in detection context**: Both first and second pass now query `ad_patterns` for the podcast being processed and include "Previously detected sponsors for this podcast: X, Y, Z" in the description section. This gives Claude prior knowledge of which sponsors have appeared in this podcast before.
- **Configured models always shown in model list**: New `_ensure_configured_models_present()` ensures that models set as first-pass or second-pass model always appear in the `/settings/models` API response, even if the wrapper API doesn't advertise them. Logs when a configured model is injected.

### Fixed
- **Opus 4.6 missing from fallback model lists**: Added `claude-opus-4-6` to fallback lists in `AnthropicClient`, `OpenAICompatibleClient`, and `AdDetector.get_available_models()`. Fallbacks are used when the wrapper API is unreachable.

---

## [0.1.236] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Non-ads extracted as ads when Claude marks them `is_ad: false`**: Added filtering in `_parse_ads_from_response()` to skip entries where `is_ad` is explicitly false/no/0 or where `classification`/`type` indicates non-ad content (content, editorial, organic, interview, etc.). This was the root cause of episodes like `it-s-a-thing:1af1082d376d` losing over half their duration -- Claude's second pass returned segments with `is_ad: false` and `classification: "content"` but the parser treated ALL entries as ads regardless.
- **Generic "Advertisement detected" fallback from unknown field names**: Replaced static allowlists for sponsor and description extraction with dynamic field scanning. Instead of maintaining lists of field names Claude might use, the parser now defines STRUCTURAL_FIELDS (timestamps, booleans, config) and treats everything else as a candidate for sponsor/description info. This eliminates the recurring need to patch field names (previously patched in v0.1.217, 218, 220, 232, 234, 235).
- **Reason field duplication when sponsor and description overlap**: Added `_text_is_duplicate()` helper that checks if one string starts with the other or they share >80% of words. Prevents output like "BetterHelp advertisement: BetterHelp advertisement for therapy services".
- **Processing queue kills long-running jobs via stale lock detection**: `_clear_stale_state()` was called from `is_busy()`/`get_current()` without `_fd_lock` protection. When a long episode exceeded `MAX_JOB_DURATION`, stale detection would release the lock from under the running thread, allowing another episode to acquire it and causing concurrent processing failures. Now checks if the current process holds the lock before clearing -- if it does, the job is still alive (just long-running) and only a warning is logged.
- **Queue timeouts too aggressive for long episodes**: Increased `MAX_JOB_DURATION` from 30 to 60 minutes in both `processing_queue.py` and `status_service.py`. Increased `background_queue_processor()` max_wait from 10 to 60 minutes and orphan check threshold from 35 to 65 minutes.

---

## [0.1.235] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **Ad detection reason parsing shows generic "Advertisement detected" instead of sponsor names**: Fixed parsing logic in `_parse_ads_from_response()` that was missing field names Claude uses. Added `sponsor_name` to `SPONSOR_PRIORITY_FIELDS` (Claude often returns this instead of just `sponsor`). Added `reason` and `notes` to description fields (Claude provides context in these). Added pre-check for valid `reason` field before running sponsor extraction - if Claude already provided a valid reason, use it directly instead of overwriting with extraction logic. This fixes the cascade where bad parsing led to no pattern creation (patterns are rejected when sponsor is "Advertisement detected").
- **Reason field duplicated in sponsor + description output**: When Claude provided a valid `reason` field (e.g., "BetterHelp advertisement for therapy"), the pre-check block correctly used it as the sponsor reason, but then the description extraction loop also matched the same `reason` field, producing duplicated output like "BetterHelp advertisement: BetterHelp advertisement". Removed `reason` from `desc_fields` since it is already handled by the pre-check block.
- **Crash on `end_text: null` from Claude response**: When Claude returns `"end_text": null` in JSON, `dict.get('end_text', '')` returns `None` (not `""`) because the key exists with an explicit null value. This caused `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` when slicing for log output. Fixed all three `end_text` access points to use `or ''` pattern which correctly converts None to empty string.

---

## [0.1.234] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Ad detection parsing missing ads_detected key and nested structures**: Fixed bug in `_parse_ads_from_response()` where Claude's ad detections were not being extracted due to missing parser support. Added support for `ads_detected` key (Claude sometimes uses this instead of `ads`). Added support for nested `window` structure (e.g., `{"window": {"ads_detected": [...]}}`). The `parse_timestamp()` function already handles string timestamps with "s" suffix (e.g., "28.8s"). This fixes episodes where Claude correctly detected ads but the parser failed to extract them.

---

## [0.1.233] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Reprocess button does nothing when queue is busy**: When clicking "Reprocess" while another episode was processing, the API returned "queued" but never actually added the episode to the processing queue. The `background_queue_processor()` only reads from the `auto_process_queue` table, so episodes that bypassed this table were never picked up. Both reprocess endpoints (`/reprocess` and `/episodes/{id}/reprocess`) now call `db.queue_episode_for_processing()` when the processing lock is busy, ensuring episodes are actually added to the queue for background processing.

---

## [0.1.232] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Ad detection parsing failures**: Fixed bug in `_parse_ads_from_response()` where valid ads were not being extracted from Claude's responses. Added support for `ads_and_sponsorships` response key (Claude sometimes uses this instead of just `ads`). Added support for `start_timestamp`/`end_timestamp` field names (Claude's alternate naming convention). This fixes 0 ads detected for episodes where Claude was correctly identifying ads but the parser couldn't extract them.
- **CUDA OOM from legacy reprocess endpoint**: The old `/feeds/<slug>/episodes/<episode_id>/reprocess` endpoint was calling `process_episode()` directly, bypassing the `ProcessingQueue` lock that prevents concurrent GPU processing. This allowed two episodes to transcribe simultaneously, exhausting GPU memory. Updated to use `start_background_processing()` like the new endpoint, ensuring proper queue coordination. The endpoint now returns 202 Accepted and processes asynchronously.

---

## [0.1.231] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Infinite episode retry loop**: Fixed bug introduced in v0.1.225 where `reset_orphaned_queue_items()` would reset stuck queue items to 'pending' indefinitely without incrementing the `attempts` counter. Episodes that repeatedly fail (e.g., CUDA OOM on long episodes) would cycle forever: fail -> reset to pending -> retry -> fail -> repeat. Now the function increments `attempts` on each reset and marks items as permanently 'failed' after exceeding `max_attempts` (default 3). This stops resource-consuming episodes from blocking the queue indefinitely.

---

## [0.1.230] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Concurrent episode processing despite fcntl.flock**: Fixed bug where two episodes could still process simultaneously within the same Gunicorn worker. The issue was that `acquire()` always opened a new file descriptor, overwriting `_lock_fd` and orphaning the previous fd. Since `flock()` is per-fd (not per-file) within the same process, the second `flock()` on a different fd would succeed. Added `_fd_lock` threading lock to synchronize access to `_lock_fd` across threads, and added early rejection if `_lock_fd` is already set (meaning this process already holds the lock). Promoted lock acquire/release logging from DEBUG to INFO for production visibility.

---

## [0.1.229] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Concurrent episode processing causing CUDA OOM**: ProcessingQueue was using `threading.Lock` which only prevents concurrent access within a single Python process. With 2 Gunicorn workers (separate processes), each had its own lock, allowing both to process episodes simultaneously and exhausting GPU memory. Replaced with `fcntl.flock()` file-based locking that coordinates across all worker processes. The lock file and state are stored in `/app/data/` for cross-process visibility.

- **Episode ID instability causing duplicates**: Same episodes were appearing multiple times in the database with different IDs because some RSS feeds (especially Megaphone) have unstable GUIDs or dynamic URL parameters. Added title+pubDate deduplication check in `refresh_rss_feed()` - before queuing a "new" episode, we now check if an episode with the same title and publish date already exists. If found, the episode is skipped with a warning log. Added `get_episode_by_title_and_date()` method to database.py.

---

## [0.1.228] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **App startup failure**: Added migration to update episodes table CHECK constraint to include `permanently_failed` status. The `permanently_failed` status was added in v0.1.225 code but the migration to update existing databases' CHECK constraint was missing. SQLite requires table recreation to modify constraints.

---

## [0.1.227] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **SQLite database locking**: Fixed "database is locked" errors that occurred during concurrent database access (e.g., when transcription completed while another operation was writing). Added `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL` for Write-Ahead Logging (allows concurrent readers with one writer) and `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 30000` (SQLite retries for 30 seconds instead of failing immediately). The existing `timeout=30.0` in `sqlite3.connect()` is Python's lock acquisition timeout, not SQLite's busy timeout - SQLite's default busy_timeout is 0 which fails immediately on lock contention.

---

## [0.1.226] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Duplicate episode ID generation**: Fixed bug where the same episode would be processed repeatedly with different IDs. The issue occurred because `generate_episode_id()` used only the audio URL, which can include dynamic CDN tracking parameters (e.g., Megaphone's `awCollectionId`/`awEpisodeId`). When these parameters changed between RSS refreshes, the same episode appeared as "new" with a different ID, causing infinite reprocessing loops. Now uses RSS GUID (stable identifier per RSS spec) with URL fallback for feeds without GUIDs.

- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed two calls to non-existent `storage.delete_ads_json()` method in reprocess endpoints. The method was removed in v0.1.26 but calls remained wrapped in try/except, causing harmless warnings. Data clearing is already handled by `db.clear_episode_details()`.

- **Queue race condition**: Moved `status_service.start_job()` call from inside the processing thread to immediately after acquiring the ProcessingQueue lock in `start_background_processing()`. This prevents a new episode from starting before StatusService knows about the current one, closing a timing gap that allowed episode overlap.

- **Ad detection progress updates**: Added `progress_callback` parameter to `detect_ads()`, `detect_ads_second_pass()`, and `process_transcript()` methods. Now reports progress for each detection window (e.g., "detecting:3/12"), keeping the UI progress indicator alive during the 2-5+ minute ad detection phase that previously caused the progress bar to disappear.

---

## [0.1.225] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed
- **Sponsor extraction garbage capture**: Fixed regex patterns in `extract_sponsor_from_text()` that would incorrectly extract common English words as sponsor names (e.g., "not an" from "This is not an advertisement", "consistent with" from Claude reasoning). Added `INVALID_SPONSOR_CAPTURE_WORDS` validation and rejection of all-lowercase multi-word phrases.

- **Queue race condition**: Fixed race condition where `db.update_queue_status(queue_id, 'processing')` was called BEFORE the processing lock was acquired. If the worker crashed between these calls, the queue item would remain stuck in 'processing' status. Now the status is only updated AFTER successfully acquiring the lock.

- **Stuck episode retry tracking**: Enhanced `reset_stuck_processing_episodes()` to track retry count and mark episodes as `permanently_failed` after 3 crashes (MAX_EPISODE_RETRIES). Prevents infinite retry loops for episodes that consistently crash workers (e.g., OOM issues).

### Added
- **Orphaned queue detection**: Added `db.reset_orphaned_queue_items()` method to detect and reset queue items stuck in 'processing' for over 35 minutes. Called periodically from the queue processor to recover from worker crashes without restart.

- **Confidence threshold logging**: Added log line at start of episode processing showing current confidence threshold (e.g., "Confidence threshold: 80%"). Helps verify the aggressiveness slider setting is being applied.

- **Podcast description in prompts**: Now passes the podcast-level description (in addition to episode description) to Claude prompts for both first and second pass ad detection. This provides additional context about the show format and typical sponsors.

### Improved
- **JSON format instructions**: Enhanced JSON output instructions for Anthropic API to be more explicit: numbered requirements, explicit "use null not None" rule, clearer formatting. Reduces JSON parse errors from malformed responses.

- **Podcast description in UI**: Added missing `description` field to `/feeds/{slug}` API response. The UI already supported displaying podcast descriptions but the API wasn't returning it.

---

## [0.1.224] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **Reprocess endpoint timeout**: Fixed 504 Gateway Timeout when reprocessing episodes. The endpoint was calling `process_episode()` synchronously, causing nginx to timeout before processing completed. Now uses `start_background_processing()` (same pattern as JIT processing) and returns 202 Accepted immediately. The frontend polls for status updates via existing mechanisms.

---

## [0.1.223] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed
- **Full Analysis mode now actually processes**: Fixed backend bug where the `/episodes/{slug}/{episodeId}/reprocess` endpoint only set `status='pending'` in the database but never triggered actual processing. Episodes would remain stuck in pending status indefinitely. The endpoint now clears cached data and calls `process_episode()` synchronously, matching the behavior of the legacy reprocess endpoint.

---

## [0.1.222] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **Pattern ID column on Patterns page**: Added sortable ID column as the first column in the patterns table. Pattern IDs are now visible in both desktop table view and mobile card view.

- **Clickable pattern links in ad reasons**: Pattern references like "(pattern #63)" in detected ad descriptions are now clickable links that navigate to the pattern detail modal on the Patterns page.

- **Pattern search by ID**: The search filter on the Patterns page now also matches pattern IDs, so you can search for "63" to find pattern #63.

### Fixed
- **"Full Analysis" mode ignored during reprocess**: Fixed a bug where clicking "Full Analysis" in the reprocess menu would still use patterns instead of pure Claude analysis. The frontend was calling the wrong API endpoint (`/feeds/{slug}/episodes/{episodeId}/reprocess`) which ignored the mode parameter. Now correctly calls `/episodes/{slug}/{episodeId}/reprocess` which properly handles the mode.

---

## [0.1.221] - 2026-02-02

### Improved
- **Pattern match descriptions include pattern reference**: Pattern-matched ads now show "Sponsor (pattern #X)" format in the reason field instead of just the sponsor name. This provides traceability for pattern matches, making it easier to identify and manage patterns.

### Added
- **GET /patterns/contaminated endpoint**: New endpoint to find all active patterns containing multiple ad transition phrases, indicating merged multi-sponsor ads that should be split. Returns pattern IDs, sponsors, text lengths, and transition counts.

- **POST /patterns/{id}/split endpoint**: New endpoint to split a contaminated pattern into separate single-sponsor patterns. Uses the existing `TextPatternMatcher.split_pattern()` method to detect ad transitions and create individual patterns. The original pattern is disabled after successful split.

---

## [0.1.220] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Multi-sponsor pattern contamination**: Added `detect_multi_sponsor_pattern()` and `split_pattern()` methods to `TextPatternMatcher` to detect and split patterns that were incorrectly created with multiple sponsor reads merged together. These methods scan for common ad transition phrases ("this episode is brought to you by", "brought to you by", etc.) and create separate patterns for each sponsor.

- **Prevention of future contamination**: Added validation to `create_pattern_from_ad()` to reject patterns with:
  - Duration > 120 seconds (reduced from 180s) - single ads rarely exceed 2 minutes
  - Multiple ad transition phrases detected - indicates merged multi-ad spans
  - Sponsor name not appearing in intro text - may indicate misattribution

- **Missing descriptions in reason field**: Enhanced `_parse_ads_from_response()` to extract Claude's explanation/description from response and combine with sponsor name in the reason field. Now checks `explanation`, `content_summary`, `description`, `ad_description`, `message`, `content`, and `summary` fields. Descriptions over 150 characters are truncated.

---

## [0.1.219] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Codebase cleanup**: Comprehensive cleanup to remove dead code, unused dependencies, and stale artifacts:
  - Deleted stale `tmp/` directory (docker-compose.wrapper.yml, llm_client.py copy, migration docs)
  - Removed unused `soundfile` dependency from requirements.txt
  - Removed unused imports from 9 Python files (ad_detector, chapters_generator, rss_parser, storage, text_pattern_matcher, transcriber, gpu, pattern_service, api)
  - Removed unused exception imports (APIError, APIConnectionError, RateLimitError, InternalServerError) from ad_detector.py
  - Fixed .gitignore duplicates (.env, *.db, *.log, pixelprobe.db) and removed contradictory CLAUDE.md entry
  - Removed TODO comment from main.py
  - Removed PLACEHOLDER env var from docker-compose.yml claude-wrapper service

---

## [0.1.218] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Reasoning field precedence bug in sponsor extraction**: Removed `reasoning` from `SPONSOR_PRIORITY_FIELDS` as it was incorrectly taking precedence over `sponsor_name` in Phase 2 pattern matching. The `reasoning` field contains descriptive text (e.g., "Host read ad for eBay promoting...") and was being returned instead of the actual sponsor name. Now `reasoning` is only used in Phase 4 for regex-based text extraction as a fallback when no direct sponsor name is found.

---

## [0.1.217] - 2026-02-01

### Improved
- **Enhanced sponsor name extraction from OpenAI wrapper responses**: Added Phase 4 text extraction to extract sponsor names from descriptive fields like `reasoning` and `summary` when direct fields are missing or invalid. Improvements include:
  - Added `reasoning` to priority fields (catches "This is a BetterHelp ad" style responses) [Note: reverted in v0.1.218]
  - Added `ad_name` and `note` to pattern keywords for fuzzy matching
  - Added `summary` to fallback fields
  - New regex-based extraction parses sponsor names from text like "X advertisement", "ad for X", "promoting X"
  - Reduces generic "Advertisement detected" labels when Claude provides sponsor info in descriptive fields

---

## [0.1.216] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **XML entity encoding in RSS feeds**: Escape all text content and URLs when generating modified RSS feeds to prevent invalid XML from unescaped ampersands in URLs. Applies `_escape_xml()` to channel title, link, language, image fields, and item link, guid, pubDate fields. Fixes potential XML parsing errors in podcast apps when feed URLs contain tracking parameters with `&` characters.

---

## [0.1.215] - 2026-02-01

### Changed
- **Refactored advertiser field extraction**: Replaced the hardcoded 16-field fallback chain with a flexible three-phase approach:
  1. Priority fields checked in order: `reason`, `advertiser`, `sponsor`, `brand`, `company`, `product`, `name`
  2. Pattern matching scans all keys for substrings: `sponsor`, `brand`, `advertiser`, `company`, `product` (catches variants like `ad_sponsor`, `sponsor_name`, `detected_brand`)
  3. Fallback fields: `description`, `content_summary`, `ad_content`, `category`
- This eliminates the need to manually add new field names whenever Claude uses a variation

---

## [0.1.214] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Added `detected_brand` to fallback chain**: Claude sometimes uses `detected_brand` as the field name for advertiser. Added to the fallback chain to extract sponsor names from this field.

---

## [0.1.213] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Filter invalid sponsor values**: Added validation to filter out literal string values like "None", "unknown", "null", "n/a" that Claude sometimes returns as sponsor names. These invalid values are now properly skipped in the fallback chain, allowing the next valid field to be used or falling back to "Advertisement detected" instead of displaying unhelpful values.

---

## [0.1.212] - 2026-02-01

### Fixed
- **Expanded advertiser field fallback chain**: Added `ad_sponsor`, `sponsor_name`, and `sponsor_or_product` to the fallback chain for extracting advertiser names. These field names were discovered via enhanced logging when Claude uses alternate response structures. Fixes more cases where ads showed as generic "Advertisement detected" instead of actual advertiser names like "Stash", "Ethos", "Mint Mobile".

---

## [0.1.211] - 2026-01-31

### Changed
- **Enhanced ad extraction logging**: Promoted ad extraction logging from DEBUG to INFO level for production visibility. When ads are extracted from LLM responses, logs now show the timestamps, reason/advertiser, and available fields - helping diagnose when ad names show as generic "Advertisement detected" instead of actual advertiser names.

### Fixed
- **Added `category` to advertiser field fallback**: Some Claude responses use `category` as the advertiser/reason field. Added to the fallback chain to extract more descriptive ad names.

---

## [0.1.210] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **Display advertiser names in pattern-matched ads**: Text pattern and fingerprint matches now use the sponsor name from the database pattern as the `reason` field instead of generic labels like "Text pattern match (outro, pattern 69)". Falls back to generic label if no sponsor is defined for the pattern.

---

## [0.1.209] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **Expanded advertiser name extraction**: Added more field name patterns for extracting advertiser/sponsor names from Claude responses: `sponsor`, `brand`, `company`, `name`, `description`, `ad_content`. Fixes ads showing as generic "Advertisement detected" instead of the actual advertiser name.
- **Debug logging for ad extraction**: Added debug logging to show extracted ad details and available fields, helping diagnose future field name issues.

---

## [0.1.208] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **Handle Claude's elaborate response structures**: Claude sometimes ignores the prompt's output format and returns elaborate structured objects with `segments` or `advertisement_segments` keys instead of `ads`. Updated Strategy 0 in `_parse_ads_from_response()` to extract ads from these alternate structures, filtering `segments` arrays to only include items with `type: "advertisement"`.
- **Handle alternate field names in ad validation**: Claude uses inconsistent field names (`start_time` vs `start`, `advertiser` vs `reason`, etc.). Updated validation loop to check multiple field name patterns: `start`/`start_time`/`ad_start_timestamp`/`start_time_seconds` for timestamps, and `reason`/`advertiser`/`product`/`content_summary` for descriptions.
- **v0.1.207 regression**: Fixed regression where objects with `segments` key containing ads were treated as "no ads found" because they lacked an explicit `ads` key.

---

## [0.1.207] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **JSON object without 'ads' key**: When Claude returns a valid JSON object but without an "ads" key (e.g., `{"status": "no_ads_detected"}`), treat it as "no ads found" rather than falling through to legacy parsing strategies that could fail with "Extra data" errors.

---

## [0.1.206] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **JSON object response parsing**: Claude in JSON mode sometimes returns `{"ads": [...]}` objects instead of raw arrays. Added Strategy 0 to `_parse_ads_from_response()` that extracts arrays from objects with "ads" key.
- **Timestamp format parsing**: Added `parse_timestamp()` helper that handles multiple formats: seconds (1178.5), MM:SS ("19:38"), HH:MM:SS ("1:19:38"), and strings with "s" suffix ("1178.5s"). Fixes "could not convert string to float" errors when Claude returns human-readable timestamps.

---

## [0.1.205] - 2026-01-31

### Fixed
- **JSON response format for OpenAI-compatible LLM backends**: Added `response_format` parameter to `LLMClient.messages_create()` interface and pass `{"type": "json_object"}` for ad detection calls. This triggers JSON mode in the Claude Code OpenAI wrapper, ensuring clean JSON responses instead of markdown-wrapped output that caused "No valid JSON array found in response" warnings.

---

## [0.1.203] - 2026-01-30

### Added
- **Optional OpenAI-compatible LLM support**: New abstraction layer (`llm_client.py`) allows using alternative LLM backends instead of direct Anthropic API. Supports:
  - Direct Anthropic API (default, uses API credits)
  - OpenAI-compatible APIs (Claude Code wrapper for Max subscription, Ollama, etc.)
- **LLM provider configuration**: New environment variables `LLM_PROVIDER`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL` for configuring alternative backends
- **Docker Compose wrapper service**: Optional `claude-wrapper` service for running the Claude Code OpenAI wrapper (enable with `--profile wrapper`)

### Changed
- **Ad detector refactored for LLM abstraction**: `ad_detector.py` now uses `llm_client.py` for all LLM interactions, maintaining backward compatibility
- **Chapters generator refactored for LLM abstraction**: `chapters_generator.py` now uses `llm_client.py` for all LLM interactions
- **Updated requirements**: Added `openai>=1.0.0` dependency for OpenAI-compatible API support

---

## [0.1.202] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Incorrect Whisper VRAM profiles causing overly conservative chunking**: Updated `WHISPER_MEMORY_PROFILES` in `config.py` to match faster-whisper's actual VRAM requirements (from README). large-v3 now correctly uses 5.5GB base (was 10GB), medium uses 4GB (was 5GB), small uses 2GB (was 2.5GB). This allows larger chunk sizes and fewer chunks for long episodes.
- **System RAM incorrectly limiting GPU transcription**: Changed `get_available_memory_gb()` in `utils/gpu.py` to use GPU VRAM as the primary limit for CUDA devices, not `min(GPU, System)`. System RAM was incorrectly limiting chunk sizes when GPU VRAM was the only relevant constraint.
- **API showing incorrect VRAM requirements**: Updated `/settings/whisper-models` endpoint to show correct values: medium now shows "~4GB", large-v3 shows "~5-6GB".

### Added
- **GPU memory logging after model load**: Added INFO-level log showing actual GPU memory allocated and reserved after Whisper model initialization, helping verify correct VRAM usage.
- **Memory visibility logging**: `get_available_memory_gb()` now logs both GPU and System RAM values at INFO level when running on CUDA, providing visibility into memory decisions.

---

## [0.1.201] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Uptime not resetting on container restart**: The `_get_start_time()` function in `api.py` was returning the stale value from the status file without calling `set_server_start_time()`. Renamed to `_init_server_start_time()` and now always writes the current time on module load, ensuring uptime resets on every server restart.

---

## [0.1.200] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Dynamic memory-aware chunked transcription**: Long episodes are now transcribed in dynamically-sized chunks based on available system RAM and GPU VRAM. The system:
  1. Queries available memory before each episode using `/proc/meminfo` and `torch.cuda`
  2. Uses model-specific memory profiles (base memory + MB/minute coefficients for each Whisper model size)
  3. Calculates optimal chunk duration with 70% safety margin
  4. Catches OOM errors during transcription and automatically retries with smaller chunks (halving up to 3 times)
  - Chunk sizes range from 5-60 minutes, with 30-second overlap for boundary alignment
  - Configurable via `CHUNK_*` and `WHISPER_MEMORY_PROFILES` in `config.py`
- **Memory cleanup on all failure paths**: Both `transcriber.py` and `main.py` now clear GPU memory and unload the Whisper model when transcription fails for any reason, preventing memory leaks during retry cycles.
- **Memory utility functions**: New `get_available_system_memory_gb()`, `get_available_gpu_memory_gb()`, and `get_available_memory_gb()` in `utils/gpu.py` for runtime memory detection.

### Fixed
- **OOM retry loops causing repeated failures**: OOM errors are now classified as permanent (non-transient) in `is_transient_error()`, preventing the 3x3=9 retry attempts that were causing the same episodes to fail repeatedly. OOM episodes are now immediately marked as `permanently_failed` instead of retrying at the episode level (chunk-level retries still occur with smaller chunks).

---

## [0.1.199] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **Uptime persists across deploys**: The `server_start_time` in the shared status file was never overwritten on container restart because `set_server_start_time()` only wrote if no value existed. Now always overwrites, ensuring uptime resets on deploy.

---

## [0.1.198] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **ProcessingQueue staleness causing permanent queue_busy**: When a worker is SIGKILL'd (OOM), StatusService correctly auto-clears stale jobs after 30 minutes, but ProcessingQueue (in-memory, per-worker) retained stale `_current_episode` state forever. Added timestamp tracking and staleness detection to ProcessingQueue, matching StatusService behavior. Also added cross-check with StatusService as truth source - if StatusService says no job is running but ProcessingQueue thinks one is, ProcessingQueue clears its state.

---

## [0.1.197] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **Text pattern matching completely broken**: Fixed numpy/scipy sparse matrix boolean evaluation error (`not self._pattern_vectors`) that caused "The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous" on every processed episode since patterns were loaded. Changed to `self._pattern_vectors is None`. This was blocking ALL text pattern matching.
- **Settings page uptime flicker**: Different gunicorn workers had different `_start_time` values because each imports `api.py` independently. Server start time is now stored in shared `processing_status.json` so all workers report consistent uptime.
- **Stale processing/queue state after worker SIGKILL**: Added staleness detection to `StatusService._read_status_file()`. Jobs running longer than 30 minutes are auto-cleared; queue entries older than 1 hour are removed. This prevents permanently stuck status after OOM kills.
- **Chapter duration inconsistency**: Added `_enforce_min_duration()` to chapters generator that enforces the 3-minute minimum across all chapter sources (description timestamps, ad gaps, AI topic splits). Previously only ad-gap chapters had minimum duration enforcement.

### Added
- **Content-based ad boundary extension**: New `extend_ad_boundaries_by_content()` in ad detection pipeline checks transcript segments immediately before/after each detected ad for sponsor names, URLs, and promotional language. Extends boundaries to capture the full ad when detection cuts off ~5 seconds early (common with DAI ads). Configurable via `config.py` constants.
- **Created date column on Patterns page**: Added sortable "Created" column to the patterns table and changed default sort to newest-first (`created_at DESC`).

---

## [0.1.196] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Text pattern matching ineffective due to contaminated patterns**: Patterns were being created from merged multi-ad spans (3-8K+ chars) that could never match the 1500-char TF-IDF window. Added validation to reject patterns with duration >180s or text >3500 chars.
- **Auto-learning creating patterns from merged ads**: Adjacent ads within 3 seconds were merged before pattern learning, contaminating patterns with multiple ads. Added higher confidence threshold (0.92) for ads >90 seconds to prevent learning from merged spans.
- **Database lock race condition on startup**: Multiple gunicorn workers initializing simultaneously caused "database is locked" errors. Added retry logic with exponential backoff (5 attempts, 0.5s-8s delays) to handle concurrent schema initialization.

### Added
- **Pattern health check API** (`/api/v1/patterns/health`): New endpoint to identify oversized/contaminated patterns with severity levels (warning >2500 chars, critical >3500 chars) and recommendations
- **Enhanced pattern matching debug logging**: Lower threshold (0.4) for debug logging with pattern length vs window length comparison to help diagnose why patterns fail to match

### Changed
- **Database migration cleans contaminated patterns**: One-time migration deletes patterns with text_template >3500 chars on startup, removing patterns that were polluting the database and could never match

---

## [0.1.195] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Pattern detail page missing podcast info**: Fixed join condition in `get_ad_patterns()` which was incorrectly comparing slug against cast numeric ID. Also updated `get_ad_pattern_by_id()` to include the same join so individual pattern lookups return `podcast_name` and `podcast_slug`
- **Auto-learned patterns missing episode ID**: `create_pattern_from_ad()` and `_learn_from_detections()` now accept and pass through `episode_id` so auto-learned patterns have `created_from_episode_id` populated

### Changed
- **Pattern detail modal shows podcast link**: Podcast-scoped patterns now show the podcast slug as a clickable link to the podcast's episode list
- **Renamed "Created from" to "Origin Episode"**: Clearer label in pattern detail modal

---

## [0.1.194] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed
- **Podcast-scoped text patterns not matching**: Fixed three related bugs preventing podcast-scoped patterns from working:
  1. `podcast_id` was never passed to `process_transcript()`, so pattern matching always received `None` and filtered out all podcast-scoped patterns
  2. Auto-created patterns stored numeric database IDs instead of slug strings
  3. Added database migration to convert existing numeric podcast_ids to slugs for consistency

---

## [0.1.193] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- **Auto pattern learning not working**: Claude-detected ads did not include a `sponsor` field, causing `_learn_from_detections()` to skip all Claude ads. Added `_extract_sponsor_from_reason()` helper that uses `SponsorService` to look up sponsor names from the `known_sponsors` database table (e.g., "ZipRecruiter host-read sponsor segment" -> "ziprecruiter") so patterns can be created automatically.

---

## [0.1.192] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Slider invisible in dark mode**: Changed slider track background from `bg-secondary` to `bg-muted` so the ad detection aggressiveness slider is visible in dark mode

---

## [0.1.191] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Off-by-one error in text pattern matching**: Fixed asymmetric boundary comparison in `_char_pos_to_time()` that caused incorrect timestamp mapping for pattern matches at segment boundaries
- **Timestamp calculation in phrase finding**: Fixed character-to-word index mapping in `find_phrase_in_words()` which was breaking at the wrong word and failing for last-word matches
- **Race condition in ad merging**: Extracted sponsor mismatch extension into separate `_extend_ads_for_sponsor_mismatch()` function to prevent mutation during iteration
- **Temp file leak in audio preprocessing**: Added `finally` block cleanup in `preprocess_audio()` to prevent orphaned temp files on error paths
- **Division by zero in ad validation**: Added MIN_DURATION_THRESHOLD constant (1ms) to protect against edge cases in duration calculations
- **Pattern scope filtering not working**: Fixed `_filter_patterns_by_scope()` to actually compare podcast_id and network_id instead of just checking scope string
- **TF-IDF vocabulary mismatch**: Added BASE_AD_VOCABULARY with common podcast ad terms to prevent sklearn vectorizer from ignoring unseen terms in new text

### Added
- **Shared utilities module** (`src/utils/`): Consolidated duplicate functions across codebase
  - `utils/audio.py`: `get_audio_duration()` with ffprobe stderr logging, `AudioMetadata` caching class
  - `utils/time.py`: `parse_timestamp()`, `format_time()`
  - `utils/text.py`: `extract_text_in_range()`, `extract_text_from_segments()`
  - `utils/gpu.py`: `clear_gpu_memory()`, `get_gpu_memory_info()`
- **Automatic pattern learning**: High-confidence Claude detections (>=85%) now automatically create podcast-scoped patterns via `_learn_from_detections()`
- **Pattern match recording**: Pattern matches are now recorded for promotion metrics via `record_pattern_match()`
- **Centralized configuration constants**: Added TFIDF_MATCH_THRESHOLD, FUZZY_MATCH_THRESHOLD, FINGERPRINT_MATCH_THRESHOLD, subprocess timeouts to config.py

### Changed
- **Increased sliding window size**: Pattern matching window increased from 500 to 1500 characters (~60 seconds of speech) with 500 character step for better coverage of longer ads
- **Consolidated duplicate code**: Removed 6 copies of `get_audio_duration()`, 6 copies of `parse_timestamp()`, 5 copies of transcript extraction, 3 copies of GPU cleanup

---

## [0.1.190] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **Music analysis timeout on long episodes**: Episodes over 1.5 hours now use "fast mode" that analyzes every 3rd frame and skips expensive HPSS (Harmonic-Percussive Source Separation) computation. This prevents the 805s+ timeouts that were occurring on 2+ hour episodes like Security Now.
- **Non-English DAI ads not detected**: Changed Whisper from `language="en"` to `language=None` for auto-detection. Non-English segments (especially Spanish ads) are now automatically flagged and treated as ads.
- **VAD filter too aggressive**: Adjusted VAD parameters to be more sensitive (`min_silence_duration_ms`: 500->1000, `speech_pad_ms`: 400->600, `threshold`: 0.3). This helps capture music-heavy ad segments that were being skipped.
- **End-of-episode ads not fully trimmed**: Ads that end within 30 seconds of the episode end are now extended to the actual end, eliminating leftover ad snippets at the end.

### Added
- **Ad detection aggressiveness slider**: New setting to control how confident the system must be before removing an ad. Lower values (50%) are more aggressive and remove more potential ads, while higher values (95%) are more conservative. Accessible via Settings page slider.
- Foreign language detection in transcription pipeline with `is_foreign_language` and `detected_language` segment attributes
- `_detect_foreign_language_ads()` method in ad detector that auto-detects non-English segments as DAI ads with 95% confidence
- Fast mode music detection: `_compute_music_probability_fast()` using only spectral flatness and bass energy

### Changed
- Music detector streaming analysis now uses adaptive frame skipping based on episode length
- Block length increased from 256 to 512 for more efficient streaming processing

---

## [0.1.189] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **Duplicate episodes in RSS feeds**: Same episode appearing multiple times due to CDN updates (e.g., `?updated=` params) are now de-duplicated. Episodes are matched by normalized title + published date, keeping only the latest version - matching podcast app behavior.

### Changed
- **Ad editor UX improvement**: Replaced absolute MM:SS timestamp inputs with simpler relative adjustment controls. Users can now adjust ad boundaries with +/- buttons and see "Start: +X sec" / "End: -Y sec" which is more intuitive since the audio they hear is the processed version with ads removed.

### Added
- `cleanup_duplicate_episodes()` database function for removing existing duplicates

---

## [0.1.188] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- **RSS 503 errors after episode processing**: RSS cache was being deleted after processing, but when upstream returned 304 Not Modified there was no content to regenerate. Now regenerates RSS immediately after processing completes, and forces full fetch when cache is missing as a fallback.
- **Auto-process timeout incorrectly marked as failure**: When processing takes longer than 10 minutes (common for 1-2 hour episodes), the auto-process queue was marking the episode as "failed" with no error message, even though processing was still running. Now correctly detects ongoing processing and re-queues for later status check instead of failing.

---

## [0.1.187] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed
- **Transcripts/chapters now appear immediately in podcast apps**: RSS cache is now invalidated after episode processing completes, ensuring Podcasting 2.0 tags are included right away instead of waiting for next feed refresh
- **Reduced failures for newly published episodes**: Added CDN availability check (HEAD request) before downloading audio. When CDN returns 4xx/5xx, the error is classified as transient and will be retried instead of failing immediately
- **Improved back-to-back ad detection**: When an ad's end_text contains a different sponsor's URL (e.g., ad for "Better Wild" ending with "mintmobile.com"), the system now looks for the next detected ad. If that ad's sponsor matches the end_text URL, the current ad is extended to meet it, eliminating gaps between consecutive ads from different sponsors

---

## [0.1.186] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Podcasting 2.0 chapters not appearing in podcast apps**: Fixed incorrect MIME type for chapters. The spec requires `application/json+chapters` but we were using `application/json`. Updated both the RSS tag type attribute and HTTP Content-Type header.

---

## [0.1.185] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Episode descriptions missing for auto-processed episodes**: Episodes processed via the auto-process queue were not receiving descriptions from the RSS feed. The queue system now stores and passes descriptions through to processing. Episodes that were only auto-processed will need to be reprocessed to get their descriptions populated.

---

## [0.1.184] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Ad validation false positive bug**: Fixed `NOT_AD_PATTERNS` regex that incorrectly rejected high-confidence ads (99%) when Claude's reason contained phrases like "unrelated to episode content". The regex now uses negative lookbehinds to exclude "unrelated to", "different from", and "not " prefixes which actually indicate something IS an ad.

---

## [0.1.183] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **AI topic detection prompt**: Made Claude output format explicit with "OUTPUT FORMAT: Return ONLY topic lines, one per line. No introduction, no explanation, no numbering." and added examples. This prevents Claude from adding preamble like "Here are the 6 major topic changes:" that caused parsing to fail.

---

## [0.1.181] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **VTT chapter regeneration**: Fixed critical bug where regenerating chapters from VTT caused double timestamp adjustment. VTT segments are already adjusted for removed ads, so the regenerate endpoint now uses a new `generate_chapters_from_vtt` method that works directly with VTT timestamps and uses AI topic detection without ad-based adjustment.

### Changed
- **UI improvement**: Moved "Regenerate Chapters" into the Reprocess dropdown menu for cleaner UI

---

## [0.1.179] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Regenerate chapters endpoint**: New API endpoint `POST /feeds/<slug>/episodes/<episode_id>/regenerate-chapters` to regenerate chapters without full reprocessing. Uses existing VTT transcript and ad markers.
- **UI button for regenerate chapters**: Added "Regenerate Chapters" button to episode detail page for episodes with VTT transcripts

---

## [0.1.178] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Chapter generation debugging**: Added detailed logging to see Claude's response when detecting topic boundaries. This will help diagnose why AI split is returning 0 topics.
- Improved regex pattern to handle various timestamp formats (MM:SS, MM:SS:, MM:SS -)

---

## [0.1.177] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Chapter generation bugfix**: Fixed `_reverse_adjust_timestamp` to correctly map adjusted times back to original transcript times when first ad starts at 0. This was preventing AI topic splitting from finding the correct transcript segment.
- Added debug logging to `split_long_segments` for troubleshooting

---

## [0.1.176] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Improved chapter generation**:
  - Fixed HTML description parsing for timestamp extraction (handles `<br>` tags properly)
  - Content-aware chapter detection: Long segments (>15 min) are automatically split using AI topic detection
  - Topic-based chapter detection: Descriptions with topic headers but no timestamps (like Windows Weekly show notes) are matched to transcript positions using AI

---

## [0.1.175] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **Force refresh option for feeds**: Added `force` parameter to feed refresh API endpoints (`POST /api/v1/feeds/<slug>/refresh` and `POST /api/v1/feeds/refresh`) to bypass conditional GET (304 Not Modified) and regenerate RSS even when source feed hasn't changed. This is needed after code updates that change RSS format.

---

## [0.1.174] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed
- **End-of-episode ad handling**: When the last ad has less than 30 seconds of content remaining after it, the episode now ends with a beep instead of including the trailing content (which is often post-roll ad residue)

---

## [0.1.173] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Podcasting 2.0 Transcript and Chapters Support**
  - VTT transcripts with timestamps adjusted for removed ads
  - JSON chapters generated from ad boundaries and episode description timestamps
  - AI-generated chapter titles using Claude Haiku
  - New RSS namespace: `xmlns:podcast="https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0"`
  - `<podcast:transcript>` tag with VTT file URL, `rel="captions"`, and language attribute
  - `<podcast:chapters>` tag with chapters JSON URL
- New serving endpoints:
  - `GET /episodes/<slug>/<episode_id>.vtt` - VTT transcript
  - `GET /episodes/<slug>/<episode_id>/chapters.json` - Chapters JSON
- Settings UI toggles for VTT transcripts and chapters generation
- Episode detail shows VTT and Chapters badges when available
- Download links for VTT and chapters in episode detail page

### Fixed
- **Chapters startTime compatibility with podcast apps**
  - Changed from float values (738.8) to integers (739)
  - Changed minimum startTime from 0 to 1 (required by some apps like Pocket Casts)
  - Based on analysis of working No Agenda podcast feed format

### Changed
- VTT and chapters stored in database instead of filesystem
- RSS transcript tag now includes `rel="captions"` attribute
- Chapters MIME type changed to `application/json` (from non-standard type)

---

## [0.1.172] - 2026-01-01

### Added
- **Early Ad Snapping to 0:00**
  - Ads that start within 30 seconds of episode start are snapped to 0:00
  - Pre-roll ads often have brief intro audio before detection kicks in
  - New constant `EARLY_AD_SNAP_THRESHOLD = 30.0` in ad_detector.py
  - Logged when snapping occurs: "Snapped early ad to 0:00: X.Xs -> 0.0s"

- **Queue Position Tracking**
  - New `get_queue_position()` method in StatusService
  - Returns 1-based queue position for episodes waiting to be processed
  - Enables users to know when their episode will be processed

### Changed
- **Queue Busy Response**
  - Changed from HTTP 302 redirect to HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
  - Previously: Redirected to original (unprocessed) audio URL when queue busy
  - Now: Returns 503 with JSON body containing queue position and Retry-After header
  - Podcast players will now retry instead of caching the unprocessed file
  - Response includes: status, message, queuePosition, retryAfter (60 seconds)

---

## [0.1.171] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- **Search Index Pattern Column Bug**
  - Fixed incorrect column name (`text` -> `text_template`) for ad_patterns indexing

---

## [0.1.170] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- **Search Index Query Bug**
  - Fixed incorrect column name (`transcript` -> `transcript_text`) in search index rebuild
  - Fixed incorrect JOIN condition for episode_details table
  - Search now properly indexes episode transcripts

---

## [0.1.169] - 2025-12-24

### Fixed
- **Search Index Auto-Population**
  - FTS5 search index now auto-populates on startup if empty
  - Fixes search returning 0 results after fresh deployment or migration
  - Index is rebuilt automatically during database initialization

- **Mobile Transcript Editor Scroll Position**
  - Closing the transcript editor now restores the previous scroll position
  - Fixes the issue where page would jump to "Detected Ads" section header on mobile
  - Saves scroll position when opening editor, restores on close

---

## [0.1.168] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Pattern Creation from Boundary Adjustments**
  - Saving an adjustment now creates a pattern (like confirm does)
  - Uses the ADJUSTED boundaries to extract transcript text
  - Enables cross-episode pattern learning from corrected ad boundaries
  - If pattern already exists, increments confirmation count
  - Stores adjusted text in correction for future matching

---

## [0.1.167] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Cross-Episode False Positive Matching**
  - When marking a segment as "not an ad", the transcript text is now stored
  - Future detections across all episodes of the same podcast are compared against rejected segments
  - Uses TF-IDF similarity matching (threshold: 0.75) to skip similar content
  - Prevents the same show intro/outro from being repeatedly flagged as ads
  - New API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/patterns/backfill-false-positives` to populate text for existing corrections
  - New database method: `get_podcast_false_positive_texts()` for cross-episode lookup
  - Logs when detections are skipped due to cross-episode false positive match

---

## [0.1.166] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Independent Prompt Reset**
  - New "Reset Prompts Only" button in Settings page
  - Resets only system prompts without affecting models or toggles
  - New API endpoint: `POST /api/v1/settings/prompts/reset`

- **Pattern Statistics & Audit**
  - New pattern stats display on Patterns page header
  - Shows: total, active, by scope, unknown sponsor count, high false positive count
  - New API endpoint: `GET /api/v1/patterns/stats`
  - Tracks stale patterns (not matched in 30+ days)

### Fixed
- **Pattern Creation Without Sponsor**
  - No longer creates patterns when sponsor cannot be detected
  - Previously created patterns with NULL sponsor showing as "(Unknown)"
  - Added logging to confirm/reject correction handlers for debugging

---

## [0.1.165] - 2025-12-23

### Added
- **Per-Podcast Second Pass Toggle**
  - New `skipSecondPass` setting for podcasts that discuss products (tech shows, etc.)
  - Second pass detection was too aggressive for shows like Windows Weekly
  - Prevents false positives where product discussions are flagged as "subtle ads"
  - Toggle via API: `PATCH /api/v1/feeds/{slug}` with `{"skipSecondPass": true}`
  - Setting is logged during processing: "Second pass skipped (podcast setting)"

### Fixed
- **Ad Merge Bug for Overlapping Segments**
  - Fixed bug where overlapping/contained ads would shrink instead of extend
  - Example: Ad A (100-300s) + Ad B (150-200s) now correctly merges to 100-300s
  - Previously would incorrectly shrink to 100-200s, causing audio artifacts

---

## [0.1.164] - 2025-12-21

### Changed
- **Mobile Time Input UX Improvements**
  - Hide ad selector chips when editing time inputs to free up screen space
  - Hide audio player and action buttons when editing time inputs
  - Show Start and End fields side-by-side when editing (row layout)
  - Transcript segments now visible while editing, providing context
  - UI elements restore automatically when done editing (on blur)
  - Desktop layout unchanged (uses responsive breakpoints)

---

## [0.1.163] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed
- **iOS Safari Mobile Keyboard Fix**
  - Changed container height from `vh` to `dvh` (dynamic viewport height)
  - `dvh` automatically adjusts when iOS keyboard opens
  - Time input fields now remain visible and usable on iOS Safari
  - Supported on iOS Safari 15.4+, Chrome 108+, Firefox 101+

---

## [0.1.162] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed
- **Mobile Keyboard No Longer Resizes Viewport**
  - Added `interactive-widget=overlays-content` to viewport meta tag
  - Keyboard now overlays content instead of pushing UI elements off screen
  - Supported in Chrome 108+, Firefox 132+ (Safari falls back gracefully)
  - Removed previous workaround that hid transcript during time input editing

- **Desktop Boundary Controls Spacing**
  - Start/End time fields now centered with consistent spacing
  - Changed from `justify-between` to `justify-center` layout

---

## [0.1.161] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed
- **Transcript Editor Boundary Controls Visibility**
  - Fixed boundary controls (Start/End time inputs) not visible on desktop
  - Removed `landscape:hidden` class that hid controls when viewport is wider than tall
  - Time input fields now stay visible when mobile keyboard opens
  - Transcript list hides temporarily on mobile during time input editing
  - Ensures boundary controls remain accessible on both desktop and mobile

---

## [0.1.160] - 2025-12-21

### Fixed
- **Transcript Editor Mobile Keyboard Bug**
  - Fixed keyboard dismissing when typing in time input fields on mobile
  - Added refs and useEffect to restore focus after state change re-renders
  - Added `inputMode="decimal"` for numeric keypad on mobile
  - Reordered onFocus logic to set value before editing state for smoother UX

---

## [0.1.159] - 2025-12-21

### Added
- **Transcript Editor Manual Time Entry**
  - Start and end times now editable via direct text input
  - Supports MM:SS format (e.g., "1:30") or seconds only (e.g., "90")
  - Click to edit, Enter to confirm, Escape to cancel

  - Workers were being killed: "Worker (pid:10) was sent SIGKILL! Perhaps out of memory?"
  - Queue ensures only one memory-intensive operation at a time
- Episodes stuck in "processing" status after worker crash
  - Previously required deleting and re-adding the entire podcast
  - Now auto-reset on startup and cancellable via UI

---

## [0.1.82] - 2025-12-05

### Added
- Episode-specific artwork support
  - Extract `<itunes:image>` from RSS episode entries
  - Store artwork URL in episodes database table
  - Pass through episode artwork in modified RSS feed
  - Include `artworkUrl` in API episode responses

### Fixed
- Long sponsor ads (5+ min) rejected despite being real sponsors
  - If sponsor name from ad matches sponsor listed in episode description, allow up to 15 minutes
  - Parses `<strong>Sponsors:</strong>` section and sponsor URLs from description
  - Bitwarden, ThreatLocker, and other confirmed sponsors now correctly processed
  - Added `MAX_AD_DURATION_CONFIRMED = 900.0` (15 min) for confirmed sponsors

### Changed
- Parallelized RSS feed refresh to prevent app lockup during bulk operations
  - Uses ThreadPoolExecutor with max_workers=5 for concurrent feed fetches
  - Each feed can take 30+ seconds; parallel refresh reduces total time significantly
- Increased gunicorn workers from 1 to 2 and threads from 4 to 8
  - Better handles concurrent requests during heavy operations
  - Reduces UI freezing during bulk feed refreshes

---

## [0.1.76] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- Same-sponsor ad merge extracting "read" as a sponsor name
  - `extract_sponsor_names()` was matching "sponsor read" and extracting "read" as a brand
  - Added exclusion list: read, segment, content, break, complete, partial, full, spot, mention, plug, insert, message, promo, promotion
  - Prevents false sponsor matches that caused unrelated ads to merge
- Same-sponsor merge creating over-long ads that get rejected by validator
  - Added 300s (5 min) maximum duration check before merging
  - If merge would exceed limit, ads are kept separate instead
  - Root cause: Two legitimate ads (~155s + ~75s) were incorrectly merged into 351s ad, which AdValidator rejected as too long

---

## [0.1.75] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- Configurable Whisper model via API and Settings UI
  - New `/settings/whisper-models` endpoint lists available models with VRAM/speed/quality info
  - Settings page now includes Whisper Model dropdown with resource requirements
  - Supports: tiny, base, small (default), medium, large-v3
  - Model hot-swap: changing model triggers reload on next transcription
- Podcast-aware initial prompt for Whisper transcription
  - Includes sponsor vocabulary (BetterHelp, Athletic Greens, Squarespace, etc.)
  - Improves accuracy of sponsor name transcription
- Hallucination filtering for Whisper output
  - Filters common artifacts: "thanks for watching", "[music]", repeated segments
  - Removes YouTube-style hallucinations that don't belong in podcasts
- Audio preprocessing before transcription
  - Normalizes to 16kHz mono (Whisper's native format)
  - Applies loudnorm filter for consistent volume levels
  - Highpass (80Hz) and lowpass (8kHz) for speech frequency focus

### Changed
- WhisperModelSingleton now reads configured model from database settings
- Model can be changed at runtime without server restart
- Transcription now logs which Whisper model is being used

---

## [0.1.74] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- Frontend now displays rejected ad detections in a separate "Rejected Detections" section
  - Shows validation flags explaining why each detection was rejected
  - Styled with red/warning colors to distinguish from accepted ads
  - Displays the reason and confidence for each rejected detection

---

## [0.1.73] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- Post-detection validation layer for ad markers (AdValidator)
  - Boundary validation: clamps negative start times and end times beyond episode duration
  - Duration checks: rejects ads <7s or >300s, warns on short (<30s) or long (>180s) segments
  - Confidence thresholds: rejects very low confidence (<0.3), warns on low (<0.5)
  - Position heuristics: boosts confidence for typical ad positions (pre-roll, mid-roll, post-roll)
  - Reason quality: penalizes vague reasons, boosts when sponsor name mentioned
  - Transcript verification: checks for sponsor names and ad signals in transcript text
  - Auto-correction: merges ads with <5s gaps, clamps boundaries to valid range
  - Decision engine: classifies ads as ACCEPT, REVIEW, or REJECT
  - Ad density warnings: flags if >30% of episode is ads or >1 ad per 5 minutes
- API now returns rejected ads separately in `rejectedAdMarkers` field
  - ACCEPT and REVIEW ads are in `adMarkers` (removed from audio)
  - REJECT ads are in `rejectedAdMarkers` (kept in audio for review)
- Timestamp precision guidance added to detection prompts
  - Instructs model to use exact [Xs] timestamps, not interpolate

### Changed
- Ad removal now only processes ACCEPT and REVIEW validated ads
- REJECT ads stay in audio but are stored for display in UI

---

## [0.1.72] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- Wrap descriptions in CDATA to fix invalid XML in RSS feeds
  - Channel descriptions were not escaped, causing raw HTML and `&nbsp;` entities to break XML parsing
  - Episode descriptions now also use CDATA for consistency
  - Fixes Pocket Casts rejecting feeds with HTML in descriptions (e.g., No Agenda, DTNS)

### Changed
- OpenAPI version is now dynamically injected from version.py
  - No longer need to manually update openapi.yaml version

---

## [0.1.71] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- Validate iTunes fields before outputting to RSS feed
  - `itunes:explicit` was outputting Python's `None` as string "None" (invalid XML)
  - `itunes:duration` could also output `None` in some cases
  - Now validates `itunes:explicit` against allowed values (true/false/yes/no)
  - Skips fields with invalid values instead of outputting malformed XML
  - Fixes Pocket Casts rejecting feeds with invalid iTunes tags

---

## [0.1.70] - 2025-12-03

### Fixed
- Limited RSS feed to 100 most recent episodes
  - Large feeds (2000+ episodes, 3MB+) were rejected by Pocket Casts during validation
  - Feed size now stays under ~500KB, compatible with all podcast apps

---

## [0.1.69] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- Removed `<itunes:block>Yes</itunes:block>` from modified RSS feeds
  - This tag was preventing podcast apps from subscribing to feeds
  - Original feeds (e.g., Acast) don't have this tag; it was being added unnecessarily

---

## [0.1.68] - 2025-12-02

### Changed
- Improved ad detection prompts to reduce false positives
  - Removed "EXPECT ADS" language that pressured model to invent ads
  - Made second pass truly blind (no reference to first pass)
  - Removed cross-promotion from ad detection targets
  - Added explicit "DO NOT MARK AS ADS" section for cross-promo and guest plugs
- Added window boundary guidance to prompts
  - Instructions for handling partial ads at window edges
  - Clear guidance on marking ads that span window boundaries
- Enhanced window context in API calls
  - Clearer formatting with explicit window boundaries
  - Instructions for partial ad handling
- Consolidated prompts: removed duplicate BLIND_SECOND_PASS_SYSTEM_PROMPT
  - Single source of truth in database.py
- Reduced second pass prompt from ~600 words to ~250 words

---

## [0.1.67] - 2025-12-02

### Fixed
- Removed hardcoded VALID_MODELS validation that rejected valid models like Haiku 4.5
  - Models are fetched dynamically from Anthropic API, so validation was unnecessary
  - Any model available in the dropdown is now accepted
- Updated OpenAPI documentation with secondPassModel field (was missing in 0.1.66)

---

## [0.1.66] - 2025-12-02

### Added
- Independent second pass model selection
  - New setting `secondPassModel` allows using a different Claude model for second pass
  - Visible in Settings UI when Multi-Pass Detection is enabled
  - Defaults to Claude Sonnet 4.5 for cost optimization
  - API: PUT /settings/ad-detection accepts `secondPassModel` field
- Sliding window approach for ad detection
  - Transcripts are now processed in 10-minute overlapping windows
  - 3-minute overlap between windows to catch ads at chunk boundaries
  - Applies to both first and second pass detection
  - Detections across windows are automatically merged and deduplicated
  - Improves accuracy for long episodes

### Technical
- New database setting: `second_pass_model`
- New helper functions: `create_windows()`, `deduplicate_window_ads()`
- New method: `get_second_pass_model()` in AdDetector class
- Constants: `WINDOW_SIZE_SECONDS=600`, `WINDOW_OVERLAP_SECONDS=180`
- Refactored JSON parsing into reusable `_parse_ads_from_response()` method

---

## [0.1.65] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- Second pass prompt is now configurable via Settings UI and API
  - New textarea in Settings page (shown when Multi-Pass Detection is enabled)
  - API endpoint PUT /settings/ad-detection accepts secondPassPrompt field
  - Stored in database like other settings, with reset-to-defaults support

### Changed
- Renamed "System Prompt" to "First Pass System Prompt" in Settings UI for clarity
- Updated OpenAPI documentation with secondPassPrompt fields

---

## [0.1.64] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- Moved episode description below playback bar in episode detail view
  - Audio player now appears immediately after title/metadata
  - Description follows below for better UX (play first, read second)

---

## [0.1.63] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Same-sponsor merge now works for short gaps without requiring sponsor mention in gap
  - If gap < 120 seconds AND both ads mention same sponsor: merge unconditionally
  - This fixes cases where transition content between ad parts doesn't mention sponsor
  - Example: Vention ad with 46s gap of "Mike Elgin" intro content now merges correctly

### Changed
- Sponsor extraction now also parses ad reason field
  - Extracts brand name from "Vention sponsor read" -> "vention"
  - Helps identify same-sponsor ads even when transcript doesn't have clear URL

---

## [0.1.62] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- Same-sponsor ad merging to fix fragmented ad detection
  - Extracts sponsor names from transcript (URLs, domain mentions)
  - If two ads mention same sponsor AND gap between them also mentions that sponsor, merge them
  - Fixes cases where Claude fragments long ads into pieces or mislabels parts
  - Example: Vention ad split into 3 parts with "Zapier" mislabel now merges correctly

### Technical
- New `extract_sponsor_names()` function - finds sponsors via URL/domain patterns
- New `get_transcript_text_for_range()` - gets transcript text for time ranges
- New `merge_same_sponsor_ads()` - merges ads with same sponsor in gap content
- Max gap of 5 minutes for sponsor-based merging
- Runs after boundary refinement, before audio processing

---

## [0.1.61] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- Intelligent ad boundary detection using word timestamps and keyword scanning
  - Whisper now returns word-level timestamps (without splitting segments)
  - Post-processing scans for transition phrases near detected ad boundaries
  - Transition phrases like "let's take a break", "word from our sponsor" adjust START time
  - Return phrases like "anyway", "back to the show" adjust END time
  - Falls back to segment-level boundaries if no keywords found
  - Adapts to each podcast's style instead of using hardcoded buffers

### Technical
- New `refine_ad_boundaries()` function in ad_detector.py
- AD_START_PHRASES and AD_END_PHRASES constants for keyword detection
- Word timestamps stored with segments but segments not split (avoids v0.1.59 issues)
- Refinement runs after merge_and_deduplicate(), before audio processing

---

## [0.1.60] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Episode descriptions now have ALL blank lines removed (single-spaced)
  - Previous regex collapsed to paragraph breaks; now removes all blank lines
- Reverted segment splitting from v0.1.59 - it made ad detection WORSE
  - v0.1.59: Splitting disconnected transition phrases from sponsor content
  - Vention ad went from wrong END (26:04-26:34) to wrong START (27:51-28:19)
  - Original 45s segments were fine for finding ad START; problem was finding END
- Rate limit handling improved for 429 errors
  - Now waits 60 seconds for rate limit window to reset before retry
  - Both first and second pass have this handling

### Changed
- Ad extension heuristic improved
  - Threshold increased from 60s to 90s (detect more potentially incomplete ads)
  - Extension increased from 30s to 45s (catch more of the actual ad content)
- Streamlined system prompt (~70% size reduction)
  - Removed redundant "find all ads" messaging (repeated 5+ times)
  - Removed second example
  - Consolidated AD END guidance sections
  - Removed REMINDER sections that repeated earlier content
  - Kept brand lists (helpful for detection)
  - Result: ~3KB prompt instead of ~11KB, fewer tokens consumed

---

## [0.1.59] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Improved whitespace collapsing in episode description display
  - Better regex that handles consecutive whitespace-only lines
  - Previous regex only handled pairs, not runs of blank lines

### Changed
- Dramatically improved ad detection precision with finer transcript granularity
  - **Root cause**: Whisper VAD was creating 45+ second segments, making precise ad boundaries impossible
  - Enabled word-level timestamps in Whisper transcription
  - Added segment splitting: long segments (>15s) are now split on word boundaries
  - Result: ~3x more segments but much more precise ad start/end detection
- Added automatic extension for short ads that end on URLs
  - If ad is under 60s and end_text contains a URL, extend by 30s
  - Safety net for cases where Claude still ends too early at first URL mention

---

## [0.1.58] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Improved newline collapsing in episode description display
  - Now handles lines containing only whitespace (spaces/tabs)
  - Previous regex only matched truly empty lines

### Added
- end_text logging for ad detection debugging
  - Logs the last 50 chars of end_text for each detected ad segment
  - Helps understand why Claude thinks an ad ended where it did

### Changed
- Enhanced AD END SIGNALS guidance in both prompts
  - Added explicit "FINDING THE TRUE AD END" section
  - Clarifies that ad ends when SHOW CONTENT resumes, not when pitch ends
  - Lists signals to look for AFTER the pitch (topic change, "anyway", etc.)
  - Lists what NOT to end on (first URL, product description, pauses)

---

## [0.1.57] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Removed seed parameter from API calls (not supported by Anthropic SDK)
- Collapsed excessive newlines in UI description display (3+ newlines -> 2)

---

## [0.1.56] - 2025-12-01

### Added
- Description logging: logs when episode description is/isn't included in prompts
- Prompt hash logging: logs MD5 hash of prompt for debugging non-determinism

### Changed
- Prompts now indicate ads are ALWAYS expected (empty result almost never correct)
- Description context clarified in prompts (describes content topics, may list sponsors)
- UI description display preserves formatting (line breaks, list items)

---

## [0.1.55] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Improved ad segment end time detection in second pass prompt
  - Added explicit instructions for finding COMPLETE ad segments
  - Ads under 45 seconds now trigger verification prompt for true end time
  - Added AD END SIGNALS guidance (transitions, topic returns, stingers)
  - Root cause: DEEL ad detected as 29s when actual duration was 92s

### Added
- Episode descriptions now available in UI and API
  - Descriptions extracted from RSS feed and stored in database
  - Displayed below episode title in list and detail views
  - Passed to Claude for ad detection (helps identify sponsors, chapters)
  - HTML tags stripped for clean display
- Short ad duration warning in logs
  - Warns when detected ads are under 30 seconds (typical ads are 60-120s)
  - Helps identify potentially incomplete ad segment detection

### Changed
- Enhanced `BLIND_SECOND_PASS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` with boundary detection guidance
- `USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` now includes optional episode description field
- Database schema: added `description` column to episodes table

---

## [0.1.54] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- Fixed `adsRemovedFirstPass` and `adsRemovedSecondPass` count calculation
  - Previous: calculated as `total - firstPassCount` which gave negative/incorrect values after merging
  - New: counts based on actual `pass` field in merged results
  - `first_pass_count = first_only + merged` (ads found by first pass)
  - `second_pass_count = second_only + merged` (ads found by second pass)
- Improved logging to show breakdown: `first:X, second:Y, merged:Z`

---

## [0.1.53] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- Second pass now runs BLIND (no knowledge of first pass results)
  - Previous approach: tell second pass what first pass found, ask to find more
  - New approach: second pass analyzes independently with different detection focus
  - Second pass specializes in subtle/baked-in ads that don't sound like traditional ads
  - Results merged automatically using improved algorithm
- Improved merge algorithm for combining pass results
  - Overlapping segments merged: takes earliest start, latest end
  - Adjacent segments (within 2s gap) also merged
  - Non-overlapping segments kept as separate ads
  - Ads now marked as `pass: 1`, `pass: 2`, or `pass: 'merged'`
- UI shows "Merged" badge (green) for segments detected by both passes

### Technical
- `BLIND_SECOND_PASS_SYSTEM_PROMPT` replaces previous informed prompt
- `detect_ads_second_pass()` no longer takes `first_pass_ads` parameter
- `merge_and_deduplicate()` rewritten with interval merging algorithm
- Frontend types: `AdSegment.pass` now `1 | 2 | 'merged'`

---

## [0.1.52] - 2025-12-01

### Changed
- Made second pass ad detection more aggressive
  - Reframes first pass reviewer as "junior/inexperienced" to encourage skepticism
  - Added "DETECTION BIAS: When in doubt, mark it as an ad"
  - Added explicit instruction to NOT just confirm first pass work
  - Removed verification step - focus only on finding missed ads
  - Should increase likelihood of catching non-obvious advertisements

---

## [0.1.51] - 2025-11-30

### Changed
- Multi-pass ad detection now uses parallel analysis instead of sequential re-transcription
  - Both passes analyze the SAME original transcript (not re-transcribed after processing)
  - Second pass now runs with different prompt to find ads first pass might have missed
  - Results merged with deduplication (>50% overlap = same ad)
  - Audio processed ONCE with all detected ads (faster, more efficient)
- Second pass prompt redesigned as "skeptical reviewer" approach
  - Given first pass results as context
  - Looks for: short ads, ads without sponsor language, baked-in ads, post-roll ads
  - Returns only NEW ads not already found by first pass

### Added
- Per-pass ad tracking in database and UI
  - New columns: `ads_removed_firstpass`, `ads_removed_secondpass`
  - API returns `adsRemovedFirstPass` and `adsRemovedSecondPass` fields
  - Each ad marker now has `pass` field (1 or 2) indicating which pass found it
- Pass badges in Episode Detail UI
  - Ads marked with "Pass 1" (blue) or "Pass 2" (purple) badges
  - Header shows breakdown: "Detected Ads (11) (5 first pass, 6 second pass)"
- `merge_and_deduplicate()` function for combining pass results

### Technical
- Database migration adds `ads_removed_firstpass`, `ads_removed_secondpass` columns
- Frontend types updated: `AdSegment.pass?: 1 | 2`, `EpisodeDetail.adsRemovedFirstPass/SecondPass`

---

## [0.1.50] - 2025-11-30

### Added
- UI toggle for multi-pass ad detection in Settings page
  - New styled toggle switch to enable/disable multi-pass detection
  - Settings now properly persisted and displayed

### Changed
- Database schema: renamed `claude_prompt`/`claude_raw_response` columns to `first_pass_prompt`/`first_pass_response`
- Added new columns: `second_pass_prompt`, `second_pass_response` to store multi-pass detection data
- API response field changes (breaking change for API consumers):
  - `claudePrompt` renamed to `firstPassPrompt`
  - `claudeRawResponse` renamed to `firstPassResponse`
  - Added `secondPassPrompt`, `secondPassResponse` fields
- Second pass detection now returns and stores prompt/response for debugging

---

## [0.1.49] - 2025-11-30

### Added
- API reliability with retry logic for transient Claude API errors
  - Retries up to 3 times on 529 overloaded, 500, 502, 503, rate limit errors
  - Exponential backoff with jitter (2s base, 60s max)
  - Episodes now track `adDetectionStatus` (success/failed) in database and API
  - New endpoint: `POST /feeds/<slug>/episodes/<episode_id>/retry-ad-detection`
    - Retries ad detection using existing transcript (no re-transcription needed)
- Multi-pass ad detection (opt-in feature)
  - Enable via Settings API: `PUT /settings/ad-detection` with `{"multiPassEnabled": true}`
  - When enabled, after first-pass processing:
    1. Re-transcribes the processed audio (where first-pass ads are now beeps)
    2. Runs second-pass detection looking for missed ads
    3. First-pass ads provided as context ("we found these, look for similar")
    4. Processes audio again if additional ads found
  - Combined ad count and time saved from both passes
  - Note: Approximately doubles transcription and API costs when enabled

### Changed
- Expanded DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT for better ad detection accuracy
  - Added DETECTION BIAS guidance: "When in doubt, mark it as an ad"
  - Added RETAIL/CONSUMER BRANDS list (Nordstrom, Macy's, Target, Nike, Sephora, etc.)
  - Added RETAIL/COMMERCIAL AD INDICATORS section (shopping CTAs, free shipping, price mentions)
  - Added NETWORK/RADIO-STYLE ADS section for ads without podcast-specific elements
  - Added second example showing Nordstrom-style retail ad detection
  - Strengthened REMINDER section to catch all ad types
  - Note: Users with custom prompts should reset to default in Settings to get improvements

### Fixed
- Joe Rogan episode type issue: Claude API 529 overloaded error was silently returning 0 ads
  - Now properly retries and blocks until success or permanent failure
  - Failed detection clearly marked in UI/API (adDetectionStatus: "failed")

---

## [0.1.48] - 2025-11-29

### Added
- Enhanced request logging with detailed info
  - All routes now log: IP address, user-agent, response time (ms), status code
  - Format: `GET /path 200 45ms [192.168.1.100] [Podcast App/1.0]`
  - Applied to RSS feeds (`/<slug>`), episodes (`/episodes/*`), health check, and all API routes
  - Static files (`/ui/*`, `/docs`) excluded to reduce noise

---

## [0.1.47] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- Replaced load_data_json/save_data_json patterns with direct database calls in main.py
  - Eliminates race conditions during concurrent episode processing
  - More efficient single-episode updates (no longer loads/saves all episodes)
  - Affected: refresh_rss_feed, process_episode (start/complete/fail), serve_episode

### Added
- File size display in episode detail UI
  - Shows processed file size in MB next to duration
  - Added fileSize to API response and TypeScript types

---

## [0.1.46] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- "Detected Ads" section not showing in episode detail UI
  - Frontend still referenced `ad_segments` after API cleanup removed it in v0.1.45
  - Updated EpisodeDetail.tsx to use `adMarkers` field

---

## [0.1.45] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- Improved ad detection system prompt for better boundary precision
  - Added AD START SIGNALS section to capture transitions ("let's take a break", etc.)
  - Added POST-ROLL ADS section to detect local business ads at end of episodes
  - Updated example to show transition phrase included in ad segment
- Longer fade-in after beep (0.8s instead of 0.5s) for smoother return to content
  - Content fade-out before beep: 0.5s (unchanged)
  - Content fade-in after beep: 0.8s (was 0.5s)
  - Beep fades: 0.5s (unchanged)
- "Run Cleanup" button renamed to "Delete All Episodes"
  - Now immediately deletes ALL processed episodes (ignores retention period)
  - Uses double-click confirmation pattern (click once to arm, click again to confirm)
  - Button turns red when armed, auto-resets after 3 seconds

### Fixed
- Removed duplicate snake_case fields from episode API response
  - Removed: original_url, processed_url, ad_segments, ad_count
  - Kept camelCase equivalents: originalUrl, processedUrl, adMarkers, adsRemoved

---

## [0.1.44] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Beep replacement only playing for first ad when multiple ads detected
  - Root cause: ffmpeg input streams can only be used once in filter_complex
  - Added asplit to create N copies of beep input for N ads
  - Now all ads get proper beep replacement with fades
- RETENTION_PERIOD env var being ignored after initial database setup
  - Env var now takes precedence over database setting
  - Allows runtime override without database modification

---

## [0.1.43] - 2025-11-29

### Added
- Audio fading on replacement beep (0.5s fade-in and fade-out)
  - Creates smoother transitions: content fade-out -> beep fade-in -> beep fade-out -> content fade-in
- end_text field back in ad detection prompt for debugging ad boundary issues
  - Shows last 3-5 words Claude identified as the ad ending
  - Stored in API response for debugging, not used programmatically

### Changed
- Claude API temperature set to 0.0 (was 0.2)
  - Makes ad detection deterministic - same transcript produces same results
  - Fixes ad count varying between reprocesses of the same episode

---

## [0.1.42] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Audio fading still not working after v0.1.41 fix
  - Root cause: ffmpeg atrim filter does not reset timestamps
  - Added asetpts=PTS-STARTPTS after atrim to reset timestamps to 0-based
  - Without this, afade st= parameter was looking for timestamps that did not exist in the trimmed stream

---

## [0.1.41] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Audio fading not working due to incorrect ffmpeg afade timing
  - afade st= parameter was using absolute time instead of trimmed segment time
  - Now correctly calculates fade start relative to segment duration

---

## [0.1.40] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Ad detection regression from v0.1.38 (5 ads -> 3 ads)
  - Removed complex MID-BLOCK BOUNDARY example that overwhelmed Claude
  - Removed end_text field requirement from output format
  - Simplified prompt restores ad detection accuracy

### Added
- Audio fading at ad boundaries (0.5s fade-in/fade-out)
  - Smooths transitions when ad boundaries are imprecise
  - Note: Users with custom prompts should reset to default in Settings

---

## [0.1.39] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Ad detector not parsing "end_text" field from Claude response
  - Prompt requested end_text but ad_detector.py was not extracting it from response
  - Now correctly parses and includes end_text in ad segment data
  - Enables debugging of ad boundary precision issues

---

## [0.1.38] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- Improved ad boundary precision in DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT
  - Added required "end_text" field to output format (last 3-5 words of ad)
  - Added concrete MID-BLOCK BOUNDARY example with calculation walkthrough
  - Helps Claude identify exact ad ending points within timestamp blocks
  - Note: Users with custom prompts should reset to default in Settings

---

## [0.1.37] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- Improved DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT for better ad detection
  - Added PRIORITY instruction: "Focus on FINDING all ads first, then refining boundaries"
  - Added extended sponsor list (1Password, Bitwarden, ThreatLocker, Framer, Vanta, etc.)
  - Added AD END SIGNALS section for precise boundary detection
  - Added MID-BLOCK BOUNDARIES guidance for when ads end mid-timestamp
  - Removed "DO NOT INCLUDE" exclusion list that was causing missed detections
  - Enhanced REMINDER to not skip ads due to show content in same timestamp block
  - Note: Users with custom prompts should reset to default in Settings to get improvements

---

## [0.1.36] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- Ad detection returning 0 ads for host-read sponsor segments
  - Claude was distinguishing between "traditional ads" and "sponsor reads" and excluding the latter
  - Updated DEFAULT_SYSTEM_PROMPT with explicit instructions that host-read sponsor segments ARE ads
  - Added CRITICAL section and REMINDER to prevent Claude from excluding naturally-integrated sponsor content
  - Note: Users with custom system prompts should reset to default in Settings to get the fix

---

## [0.1.35] - 2025-11-29

### Changed
- Completed filesystem cleanup for transcript and ads data
  - Removed legacy filesystem fallback in `get_transcript()` - now reads only from database

  - 1 worker with 4 threads for concurrent request handling

---

## [0.1.33] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- Redundant file storage not actually removed in v0.1.26
  - `save_transcript()` and `save_ads_json()` were still writing `-transcript.txt` and `-ads.json` files
  - Now stores transcript and ad data exclusively in database (no more duplicate files)

---

## [0.1.32] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- `claudePrompt` field always null in episode API response
  - `save_ads_json()` in storage.py was not extracting `prompt` from ad_detector result
  - Now correctly saves prompt to database alongside raw_response and ad_markers
  - Note: Existing episodes will still have null prompt; only newly processed episodes will have it

---

## [0.1.31] - 2025-11-28

### Fixed
- `claudePrompt` and `claudeRawResponse` fields missing from episode detail API response
  - Fields were documented in v0.1.26 CHANGELOG but never added to the API response

  - Previously written to both database AND filesystem (wasted disk space)
  - Files removed: `-transcript.txt`, `-ads.json`, `-prompt.txt`
- Simplified episode cleanup - only deletes `.mp3` files (database cascade handles metadata)
- `/transcript` endpoint now reads from database instead of filesystem

### Added
- `claudePrompt` and `claudeRawResponse` fields in episode detail API response
  - Useful for debugging ad detection issues

### Removed
- Unused storage methods: `save_transcript`, `get_transcript`, `save_ads_json`, `save_prompt`, `delete_transcript`, `delete_ads_json`, `cleanup_episode_files`

---

  - Updated README, docker-compose, and Dockerfile to clarify it's in minutes
  - Changed default from 30 to 1440 (24 hours) to match original intent

---

## [0.1.15] - 2025-11-27

  - Falls back to first-to-last bracket extraction
- System prompt simplified to explicitly request JSON-only output (no analysis text)

### Added
- Search icon in header linking to Podcast Index for finding podcast RSS feeds
