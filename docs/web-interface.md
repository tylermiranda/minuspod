## Overview

The server includes a web-based management UI at `/ui/`:

- Dashboard with feed artwork and episode counts
- Add feeds by RSS URL with optional episode cap
- Feed management: refresh, delete, copy URLs, editable display title, set network override, per-feed episode cap, per-feed transcription language override, per-feed chapter mode (keep the show's own chapters or always generate; see [Podcasting 2.0](podcasting-2.0.md)), per-feed cue match threshold and cue tuning overrides, silence-snap and transition-snap toggles (see [Audio Cue Detection](audio-cues.md))
- Source feed URL shown in Feed Settings with a copy button, and editable for when a publisher moves feeds or a CDN-wrapped URL keeps failing. The server fetches and parses the new URL before saving, so a typo cannot break the feed; existing episodes are kept (matched by GUID). The refresh log also prints which URL each feed pulls from
- Per-feed max ad duration cap: ads longer than the cap are held for review instead of cut (empty = no cap; applies on the next reprocess)
- Per-feed cue-gated approval: only ads with audio-cue evidence auto-cut; others are held for review (requires cue templates)
- Per-feed processing mode: one select with five presets: standard (detect and cut ads, the default), keep content only (experimental; marks show content and removes everything else, see [How It Works](how-it-works.md)), skip ad detection (still transcribes and builds chapters, but nothing is scanned or cut; for ad-free shows), pass-through (serves episodes exactly as published, with no transcription, detection, or cutting), or cue-only (experimental; cuts from cue pairs and previously learned ad patterns, no LLM call; needs one enabled ad-break-start and one enabled ad-break-end template, and exposes a per-feed safety policy and a skip-transcription toggle, see [Audio Cue Detection > Cue-only preset](audio-cues.md#cue-only-preset))
- Feed detail page groups its controls into collapsible sections so the page stays scannable. Inside Feed Settings, everyday controls (network, source feed, auto-process, title blacklist, processing mode, queue priority, retention, original audio, language, hide unprocessed, tags) sit at the top; Segment actions, Cue tuning, and the rarely-changed Advanced controls each fold into their own card
- Per-feed episode title blacklist: glob patterns under "Skip episodes by title" skip queuing and just-in-time processing for matching titles; a "Skipped episodes" select chooses whether a skipped episode is served with original audio (default) or hidden. Manual reprocess of a skipped episode overrides the blacklist. See [Configuration > Title blacklist](configuration.md#title-blacklist)
- Per-feed queue priority (High / Normal / Low) on the feed settings page, with automatic boosts for fresh episodes (when the global "Process new episodes first" setting is on) and for plays and single reprocesses. Boost sizes are adjustable under Settings > AI & Processing > Queue Control; bulk work like Reprocess All gets no boost by default so backfills drain last. See [Configuration > Queue priority](configuration.md#queue-priority)
- Segment actions card on the feed settings page: per-category remove/beep/keep overrides, an Inherit/On/Off show-segments choice, and a bulk re-render button. A matching global **Segment actions** card in Settings sets the defaults every feed inherits. See [How It Works > Segment Categories](how-it-works.md#segment-categories)
- Per-feed retention override on the feed settings page: inherit the global window, keep the feed for a specific number of days, or archive it so nothing is ever deleted. An archived feed also survives the "Clear all processed audio" action in Settings. See [Configuration > Per-feed retention](configuration.md#per-feed-retention)
- Per-feed original audio override on the same page: inherit the global "Keep original audio" setting, or force it on or off for one feed. Discarding the uncut copy roughly halves what the feed stores and takes effect on the next episode processed
- Per-feed stat cards above Feed Settings: episode counts by status (colored to match the status badges) plus totals for episodes processed, ads removed, time saved, and LLM cost
- Dashboard feeds show compact per-status counts (for example "10 Disc / 2 Pend / 4 Comp") so feed health is visible without clicking in
- Ad Distribution panel on the feed detail page: a histogram of where ads have historically been cut across the feed, with learned prior zones marked
- Feed page artwork links to the show's website in a new tab, when the feed declares one
- Episode discovery: all episodes surface on refresh, process any episode from the feed detail page
- Bulk actions: select multiple episodes to process, reprocess, run a full analysis, re-detect ads on the existing transcript, or delete (the per-episode Recut Audio mode is not a bulk action)
- Sort by publish date, episode number, or creation date; paginated (25/50/100/500 per page)
- Pattern management: view and manage cross-episode ad patterns with sponsor names; the detail modal edits a pattern's sponsor, text template, active state, and segment category; includes an Ad Review tab for triaging detections across all podcasts
- Review decisions are recorded as you make them, then applied together. The Ad Review and Detected Ads pages show an Apply recuts button that recuts each waiting episode once, however many decisions it collected
- Segment category is editable in place: on an Ad Review or Detected Ads row, in the Detected ad window, and per pattern in the Ad Patterns table. It is what decides whether a span is cut, beeped, or left in
- Sponsor management: view, add, edit, and remove sponsors, each with its linked-pattern count, created and last-matched dates, and tags
- Processing history with stats, filtering by podcast, and CSV/JSON export; failed runs show their error reason under the episode title, with the full text on hover
- Stats dashboard with charts: avg/min/max metrics, top podcasts by ads, episodes by day, token usage, sortable podcast table, and an addressing-modes card comparing contract compliance and ad yield per mode (see [Configuration > Ad Addressing Mode](configuration.md#ad-addressing-mode))
- JSON schema response format (Settings > LLM Provider): opt-in for OpenAI-compatible endpoints, probed per model, falling back to plain JSON mode where it is not supported (see [Configuration](configuration.md#json-schema-response-format))
- Settings for LLM provider, AI models, ad detection prompts, retention, system stats, token usage and cost. Each customizable prompt has its own Reset button next to its label (visible but disabled at default), alongside the section-wide reset-all button
- Scheduled database backups (Settings > Data & Security): cron schedule, destination, keep count, and a Back up now button that works even with the schedule off
- Offline queue (Settings > Queue Control): optionally hold episodes while a self-hosted LLM or Whisper endpoint is down and process them automatically when it returns, with a configurable give-up window
- Rate-limit hold (Settings > Queue Control): optionally pause the queue while the LLM provider reports a 429 with a reset time, instead of failing episodes, with its own give-up window
- Processing Queue panel (Settings): the waiting list is paginated, and each row has a priority field with -/+ buttons that can raise or lower its place in the queue
- Real-time status bar showing processing progress across all pages
- OPML export with original or ad-free (modified) feed URLs
- Optional cover-art badge that marks the filtered feed (Settings > Cover Art), with a Refresh all artwork button
- Global Defaults group in settings (Auto-Process, Max Feed Episodes, Only Expose Processed) that every feed inherits, with per-feed overrides on each feed's settings page; Queue priority boosts live in the Queue Control group
- Notifications for processed episodes, permanent failures, auth failures, exhausted spend limits, and structural rate-limit hits, delivered by webhooks or native email (Settings > Notifications)
- Podcast search via PodcastIndex.org
- Multiple dark themes (Tokyo Night, Dracula, Catppuccin, Nord, Gruvbox, Solarized, and more) with light/dark toggle
- Installable as Progressive Web App (PWA)

### Feed Display Title

Each feed's title is editable. On the feed detail page, click the pencil next to the feed name, type a new name, and Save. Subscribers see this name in their podcast app: MinusPod rewrites the `<title>` in the served RSS and leaves the source feed's own title untouched. A "Custom" badge marks a feed that has an override; saving the field blank drops back to the source title.

Titles are capped at 500 characters and collapsed to one line, so a rename or a suffix like " (ad-free)" works, while newlines and control characters are stripped to keep the feed well-formed. Saving a new title regenerates the served feed, so the name updates on the app's next refresh.

### Sponsors and Normalizations

The Sponsors page lists known sponsors, each with its linked ad-pattern count, created date, last-matched date, and tags. You can add and edit a sponsor's name, aliases, category, and tags, toggle it active or inactive, filter by tag, search by name, and reveal inactive sponsors.

Deleting a sponsor is permanent. Ad patterns linked to it are not deleted: their sponsor link is cleared (unlinked) so no pattern data is lost. The confirmation dialog shows how many patterns will be unlinked first.

Name normalizations moved to Settings > AI & Processing > Transcript Normalization: regex rules that rewrite messy or inconsistent sponsor names into one canonical form before matching (for example collapsing `ag 1`, `ag-1`, and `ag one` to `ag1`). The rules correct any misheard Whisper output, sponsor names included.

#### Normalization regex format

Each rule has two fields: `terms` (the regex to find) and `canonical` (the replacement). Rules are Python regular expressions applied with `re.sub` and the case-insensitive flag, so matching ignores case. A few specifics worth knowing:

- The text is lowercased before the rules run, so write `terms` against lowercase. After all rules run, runs of whitespace are collapsed to single spaces.
- Patterns are not anchored: they match anywhere in the text. Add `^` and `$` to anchor to the whole string.
- The replacement's casing decides what the rule does. An all-lowercase `canonical` (e.g. `ag1`) only canonicalizes the name used for matching. A `canonical` containing an uppercase letter (e.g. `Wegovy`) also acts as a transcript display correction, rewriting the visible transcript while preserving the casing around the match.
- The regex is validated when you save a rule; an invalid pattern is rejected with an error.
- `category` is one of `sponsor`, `url`, `number`, or `phrase`.

The API exposes these fields as `terms`/`canonical`; the older names `pattern`/`replacement` are still accepted when writing a rule.

### Ad Review Modes

The ad editor supports two review modes, selected by a toggle above the ads list:

- **Processed** (default): plays the post-cut output so you can verify what the final listener will hear. Ad timestamps map onto the new timeline.
- **Original**: plays the pre-cut download at the ad's original timestamps, so you can hear exactly what was removed.

Original mode requires the pre-cut audio to have been retained. That's controlled by the "Keep original audio for ad boundary review" toggle under Settings > Storage & Retention (default on). Keeping originals roughly doubles per-episode storage; disable it if disk is tight. Episodes processed before v1.6.0 have no retained original. The toggle is disabled (with a tooltip) until you reprocess.

Both of these are global defaults. Any single feed can override them on its own settings page: an archived feed keeps every episode indefinitely, and the original audio choice can be forced on or off per feed regardless of the global toggle. See [Configuration > Per-feed retention](configuration.md#per-feed-retention).

Since 2.5.14, original audio has its own retention input under the same section: "Retain original audio for: N days". Defaults to whatever the processed retention is, so existing installs see no change. Set a smaller number to drop the pre-cut copy sooner while keeping the processed file for the full retention period (useful if originals are taking too much disk but you still want the processed output around for the normal 30-day window). Capped at the processed retention by the server; the input is disabled when "Keep original audio" is off.

The **Original Transcript** panel on the Episode Detail page shows the full pre-cut transcript so you can see exactly what text was identified and removed.

### Waveform Ad Editor

Review and adjust ad detections in the browser. 2.2.0 switches the editor to a wavesurfer.js waveform: drag the green start and red end pins to set boundaries, with an orange playhead, 1x to 20x zoom (slider or mouse wheel), and a transport bar (skip back, rewind 10s, play, forward 10s, skip forward, stop). 2.3.1-2.3.4 added a playback speed dropdown (0.5x to 2x) next to the play button and a full-episode scrubber under the zoom slider so you can jump anywhere in the audio regardless of how the waveform is zoomed. The scrubber shows a muted gray band for the slice currently visible in the waveform, a primary-color fill tracking playback, and a thumb at the current position. Click or drag to seek; Arrow keys nudge by 5s (Shift = 10s), Home/End jump to ends. Edit Ads opens centered on the detected ad with ~30s of context; Add new ad opens with the entire episode visible. Typing a time outside the current waveform window auto-expands the window to include the pin. The Selection text inputs clamp only to episode bounds; cross-field validation (Start before End, at least 1s) happens on Save with a red border and an inline error if invalid.

Each ad shows why it was flagged, the confidence percentage, and the detection stage. The selection readout shows the current bounds plus the originals if you've moved a pin. An INSIDE AD badge lights up when the playhead sits between the pins. Playback auto-seeks to ~2 seconds before the ad start when you open or switch ads, so you land in context instead of at the beginning of the episode.

A header row above the waveform lets you toggle Processed / Original (separate from the page-level toggle: this one applies to what plays in the editor) and jump straight into create mode with `+ Add new ad`. Waveform colors follow the active theme; the dark theme uses the same muted/primary palette as the rest of the UI so the pins and playhead stay readable on both backgrounds.

Sponsor is a real autocomplete combobox seeded from the known-sponsor catalog plus any sponsors you've used recently on this podcast. Typing filters the list; clicking a row fills the field. You can also just type a new name and submit.

On mobile the layout stacks vertically and the keyboard hint footer goes away; everything is touch-driven from there.

On desktop you get `Space` for play/pause, arrow keys to nudge the focused pin, mouse wheel to zoom in or out anchored on the cursor, and `C` / `R` / `S` to confirm / reject / skip. Clicking the dimmed backdrop closes the editor in review mode; backdrop-close is disabled in create mode so you don't lose an in-progress entry by clicking outside.

### Adding a New Ad

If the detector missed one, click `+ Add new ad` from the episode page header or from the same button inside the editor modal. The editor opens in create mode against the original (pre-cut) audio so you hear exactly what the listener would have heard.

The modal has two input modes, toggled by a tab strip at the top:

- **By audio** (default): enter start and end timestamps or drag the pins on the waveform. The text template auto-populates from the transcript span between your bounds.
- **By text**: the original transcript renders with word-level Whisper timestamps. Select a span of text in the browser; the resolved word boundaries populate the start/end timestamps and the template. A search box with `N of M` navigation jumps between matches. The selected text stays highlighted on mobile too, so the selection is visible after the keyboard closes.

Switching tabs preserves your selection, so you can refine bounds in either view. Pick a sponsor from the autocomplete or type a new one. A Category select classifies the span (sponsor, cross-promo, self-promo, and the rest); the chosen category is stamped on both the manual marker and the pattern created from it, and each feed's segment actions decide what happens to future matches. Left as Uncategorized, the pattern resolves as Sponsor. The optional Reason field is available in both modes.

Submitting creates a new pattern with `created_by='user'` and writes a `'create'` correction so the pattern matcher picks it up on future episodes. The Patterns page tags manually created patterns with a `Manual` badge and adds an Origin filter (All / Auto / Manual).

### Ad Review tab

The Patterns page has two tabs: Patterns and Ad Review. The Ad Review tab lists ad detections across all your podcasts so you can triage them without opening each episode.

Each row covers one detected segment: podcast name, episode title (linked to the episode page), publish date, start/end timestamps and duration, sponsor name, confidence score, detection stage, status, and resolution.

A Detection Statistics card above the filters shows totals by status and resolution across all podcasts. On phones the list renders as stacked cards instead of a table, with a sort control in the filter bar.

The tab opens with "Needs review" selected. That filter shows detections that are held for review or rejected with no correction yet. Other options are Pending review, Rejected, Accepted, and All. A podcast dropdown narrows the list to one feed. The search box filters by sponsor name or detection reason. The list shows 20 rows per page. Click a column header (Podcast, Published, Confidence) to sort; click again to reverse.

Each row has up to four actions:

- **Play** - auditions the pre-cut audio for that segment in the browser. Only appears when the original is retained (see Settings > Storage & Retention). Click again to pause.
- **Approve** - records a confirm correction. Triggers an immediate recut if the original audio is present; otherwise the cut applies on the next reprocess.
- **Dismiss** - records a rejection and leaves the audio unchanged.
- **Edit** - opens the waveform editor so you can adjust the ad boundaries before deciding.

Approve and Dismiss only appear for unresolved detections; the resolution badge replaces them once a decision is recorded.

Corrections go through the same per-episode corrections endpoint used on the episode page, so approve and dismiss decisions feed pattern learning the same way.

### Audio Cue Templates

If a show plays a recurring ding or stinger around its ad breaks, you can teach MinusPod that exact sound and have it snap cuts to the chime. Marking a cue, the find-audio-cues scan, the cross-episode scan, the window optimizer, cue types, and cue management are all covered in [Audio Cue Detection](audio-cues.md). Each template row shows its last match date and, once it has matched before but produced no above-threshold matches in the feed's last 5 episodes, an amber "quiet" badge, so a publisher swapping their stinger shows up before a cue-only feed silently stops cutting ads.

### Held for Review

When a feed has a max ad duration cap or cue-gated approval on, ads that cannot auto-cut are held rather than cut. The episode publishes with the audio intact. Held ads appear on the episode page in an amber "Held for Review" section with two actions per row:

- **Approve & Recut** - stores a confirm correction and immediately re-cuts the original audio if retained; otherwise the button reads Approve and the cut applies on the next reprocess.
- **Dismiss** - records a rejection and leaves the audio unchanged.

When the original audio is retained, a pencil button next to the play button opens the ad in the waveform editor, where you can drag the boundaries before confirming; confirming with moved boundaries cuts only the span inside the pins.

The episode list shows an amber "N held" chip for any episode with pending held ads. See [Held for Review](how-it-works.md#held-for-review) for what triggers a hold.

### Partial Detection

When the AI detection pass fails but pattern and cross-fetch evidence already produced cuts, the episode still publishes: an amber "Partial detection" badge appears in the episode header (hover for the failure reason), and a warning banner below explains that some ads may remain, with a **Re-run detection** button that reprocesses using the LLM. See [How It Works > Partial Detection](how-it-works.md#partial-detection) for when this happens and the automatic follow-up re-detect.

### Processing stats

Every processing run records what it actually worked with, and the episode page shows it in a "Processing stats" section at the bottom, collapsed by default. One row per run: when it ran, the length of the downloaded copy, how many detection windows the LLM answered, hits per detection stage, the final cut / held / kept split, ad time removed, the second-scan result, and token cost. Runs from before 2.53.0 and recuts only carry the basic columns.

Two things make this table earn its place. First, feeds with dynamic ad insertion serve a different copy per download: the Downloaded column shows it directly, and a note calls out when the copy differs from the duration the feed declares. Second, when a run removes far less ad time than the feed's recent average, the episode header shows an amber "Low ad yield" badge with the numbers, so a lightly-filled download does not read as a detection failure.

Completed episodes also state the verification result under the header: whether the second scan of the output audio found anything left to cut.
