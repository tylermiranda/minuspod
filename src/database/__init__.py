# Verification pass prompt - runs on processed audio to catch missed ads
DEFAULT_VERIFICATION_PROMPT = """You are reviewing a podcast episode that has ALREADY had advertisements removed. The audio has been processed -- detected ads were cut and replaced with a brief transition tone. Your job is to find anything that was MISSED or only partially removed.

CONTEXT:
This is a second pass over processed audio. The first pass already detected and removed obvious ads. What remains should be clean episode content. Anything promotional that is still present was either:
1. An ad that was completely missed
2. A fragment of an ad that was partially cut (boundary was off by a few seconds)
3. A subtle baked-in ad that blended with the conversation

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:

AD FRAGMENTS (highest priority):
- Orphaned URLs: "dot com slash podcast", "dot com slash [code]"
- Orphaned promo codes: "use code [X] for", "code [X] at checkout"
- Orphaned calls to action: "link in the show notes", "check it out at", "sign up at"
- Trailing sponsor mentions: "that's [brand].com", "thanks to [sponsor]"
- Leading transitions that survived the cut: "and now a word from", "this episode is brought to you"
These fragments appear near transition points where the previous cut boundary was slightly off.

MISSED ADS:
- Full sponsor reads that the first pass missed entirely
- Mid-roll ads without obvious transition phrases ("I've been using [product]...")
- Dynamically inserted ads that may differ in tone from the host content
- Short brand tagline ads (15-45 seconds): Network-inserted spots with concentrated marketing
  language but no promo codes or URLs. These sound like polished radio commercials -- a brand
  name, tagline, product pitch, and brand repeat. They are NOT host reads and feel tonally
  distinct from surrounding content. Flag these even without traditional ad markers.
- Quick mid-roll mentions with URLs or promo codes
- Post-signoff promotional content after the episode's natural ending

WHAT IS NOT AN AD:
- A guest discussing their own work, book, or project in the context of the interview
- The host organically mentioning their own other shows, social media, or Patreon during conversation
- Genuine topic discussion that happens to mention a brand name in passing
- Episode content that sounds slightly awkward due to surrounding ad removal
- Silence, pauses, or dead air -- these are normal, not missed ads
- Content gaps or topic transitions between segments
- Audio artifacts from the first pass ad removal (slight volume changes near cut points are expected)

PLATFORM-INSERTED ADS (these ARE ads -- flag them if still present):
- Hosting platform pre/post-rolls: "Acast powers the world's best podcasts", "Hosted on Acast",
  "Spotify for Podcasters", "iHeart Radio", etc. These are promotional insertions, not show content.
- Cross-promotions for other podcasts: Produced segments promoting a different show (different host,
  different topic) inserted by the platform or network. These are ads even without promo codes.
- Network promos: Short produced segments advertising other shows on the same network.
- The distinction: if the HOST organically says "check out my other show" during conversation,
  that's not an ad. If a PRODUCED SEGMENT with different audio/voice promotes another show or
  the hosting platform itself, that IS an ad.

NOTE: A short, polished segment with marketing language for a brand IS still an ad even if
it lacks promo codes or URLs. The distinction is: editorial content discusses a brand in
context of a story; a tagline ad is pure promotional copy with no informational value.

CRITICAL: Every ad you flag must contain identifiable promotional language in the transcript -- a sponsor name, URL, promo code, product pitch, or call to action. If the transcript text in a region is just normal conversation, silence, or a topic change, it is NOT an ad regardless of any audio signal changes.

AUDIO CUE SIGNALS: when the prompt lists a labelled audio cue inside an ad window, treat it as a strong boundary marker for that side of the break; the detailed handling (multi-cue breaks, where to start and end the span) is supplied alongside the cue in the audio signals. The cue is never an ad on its own.

HOW TO IDENTIFY FRAGMENTS:
A fragment is promotional language that appears abruptly at the start or end of a content section. In the processed audio, the flow should be: natural conversation → transition tone → natural conversation. If instead you see: natural conversation → transition tone → "...dot com slash podcast. Anyway, back to..." → natural conversation, that trailing "dot com slash podcast" is a fragment from an incompletely removed ad.

AD BOUNDARY RULES:
- AD START: First promotional word or transition phrase
- AD END: Where clean episode content resumes (after the last URL, promo code, or call to action)
- For fragments: mark the ENTIRE fragment including any surrounding promotional context
- MERGING: Multiple fragments or ads with gaps < 15 seconds = ONE segment

WINDOW CONTEXT:
This transcript may be a segment of a longer episode.
- If an ad appears to START before this segment, mark start as the first timestamp
- If an ad appears to CONTINUE past this segment, mark end as the last timestamp
- Note partial ads in the reason field

TIMESTAMP PRECISION:
Use the exact START timestamp from the [Xs] marker of the first ad segment.
Use the exact END timestamp from the [Xs] marker of the last ad segment.
Do not interpolate or estimate times between segments.

BE ACCURATE: Don't invent ads. Many episodes will be completely clean after the first pass. An empty result [] is expected and valid for well-processed episodes.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No explanation, no markdown.

Each ad segment: {{"start": FLOAT_SECONDS, "end": FLOAT_SECONDS, "confidence": FLOAT_0_TO_1, "category": "sponsor|cross_promo|self_promo|interaction|intro|outro|recap", "reason": "brief description", "end_text": "last 3-5 words"}}

"category" is REQUIRED on every object, the same as in the first pass. Use:
- sponsor: a paid host read, a produced ad spot, a dynamically inserted ad (DAI), or a platform-inserted ad
- cross_promo: a produced segment promoting a different show
- self_promo: the show promoting its own other content (another show, Patreon, merch, mailing list)
- interaction: asking listeners to subscribe, rate, review, or follow the show
- intro: the show's own opening billboard or theme
- outro: the show's own sign-off, credits, or closing theme
- recap: a summary of earlier content in the same episode
An orphaned fragment left by a cut takes the category of the ad it belonged to.

ALL values for "start", "end", and "confidence" MUST be numeric (float). Never use strings like "high", "low", "medium", or percentages like "95%". Examples: "start": 45.0, "end": 82.0, "confidence": 0.95

FRAGMENT EXAMPLE:
[120.0s - 122.0s] So yeah, that's really interesting.
[122.5s - 124.0s] [transition tone]
[124.5s - 128.0s] at athleticgreens.com slash podcast. Anyway, moving on to
[128.5s - 132.0s] the next topic I wanted to discuss was the new research.

Output: [{{"start": 124.5, "end": 128.0, "confidence": 0.95, "category": "sponsor", "reason": "Athletic Greens ad fragment -- orphaned URL after cut boundary", "end_text": "moving on to"}}]

MISSED AD EXAMPLE:
[340.0s - 342.0s] You know what I've been really into lately?
[342.5s - 348.0s] I've been using this app called Calm and it's been amazing for my sleep.
[348.5s - 365.0s] They have these sleep stories and meditations... You can try it free for 30 days at calm.com/podcast.
[365.5s - 368.0s] But anyway, getting back to what we were saying about

Output: [{{"start": 340.0, "end": 365.0, "confidence": 0.92, "category": "sponsor", "reason": "Calm app sponsor read -- missed baked-in ad with free trial URL", "end_text": "calm.com/podcast"}}]

CLEAN EPISODE EXAMPLE:
[no promotional content found in transcript]

# Both reviewer prompts use placeholder substitution via _render_prompt;
# never .format() these strings directly (the JSON examples contain literal
# curly braces that .format() would attempt to interpolate).
DEFAULT_REVIEW_PROMPT = """You are reviewing a candidate advertisement that has already been detected in a podcast episode. The transcript shows the candidate ad clearly marked, with up to 60 seconds of context before and after.

Your job is to return the corrected ad segment, OR an empty array if it is not actually an ad. Treat this exactly like ad detection on a single short window: you are emitting the ad object that should be cut from the audio, with start and end timestamps, or no object at all.

KEEP THE AD (return one segment): The candidate is a real-world advertisement that should be cut. Use the original start and end if they are already correct. Adjust them when the boundaries clip into show content or miss part of the ad:
- Start should land at or just before the first promotional word or transition phrase ("let's take a break", "and now a word from", "this episode is brought to you by")
- End should land at or just after the last call to action (final URL, promo code, sign-off), not in the middle of show content that follows
- Read adjusted timestamps off the [start-end] stamps on the transcript lines themselves, including the context lines outside the candidate markers. Never interpolate a boundary
- Adjusted boundaries must stay within {max_boundary_shift_seconds} seconds of the original boundaries in either direction

PARTIAL SPAN: if any part of the candidate span is not ad content (show content before the ad starts or after it ends), you MUST return adjusted start and end timestamps covering only the ad portion. Never return the original boundaries and describe the trim only in the "reason" text: the reason is prose for a human, and only the start and end numbers control the cut.

DROP THE AD (return empty array): The candidate is not a real-world advertisement. Reject cases:
- A guest discussing their own work, book, or project in the context of the interview
- The host organically mentioning their own other shows, social media, or Patreon as part of conversational flow (not a produced segment)
- Brand names mentioned in passing as part of genuine topic discussion, news coverage, or product reviews
- A comedic bit or fictional sponsor read that is part of the show's creative content (no real product behind it)
- Silence, pauses, or audio production artifacts with no promotional transcript content
- Topic transitions or content gaps without promotional language
You may also return [{{"is_ad": false, "reason": "why"}}] instead of an empty array to reject explicitly.

DO NOT REJECT (these ARE real ads, keep them):
- Host-read sponsor segments, including ones without promo codes
- Hosting platform pre/post-rolls (Acast, Spotify for Podcasters, iHeart Radio, etc.)
- Cross-promotions for other podcasts inserted by the platform or network (different host or voice, different topic, sounds produced)
- Network promos
- Short brand tagline ads (15-45 seconds) that sound like polished radio commercials, even without promo codes or URLs
- Dynamically inserted retail or consumer brand ads

The distinction between editorial mention and ad: an ad is paid promotional content with a sponsor name and a value proposition aimed at the listener. Editorial discussion is the host or guest talking about a topic, even if a brand name comes up.

AUDIO CUE SIGNALS: if the prompt notes a labelled audio cue next to the candidate boundary, treat it as ground truth for that side and do not move the boundary across it. When a "cue_pair" candidate is shown, the matcher bracketed the break with two cues but the transcript may be sparse; keep the ad if any promotional language sits between the cues, even if the boundaries look loose.

WHEN IN DOUBT: Keep the ad with original boundaries unchanged. Do not drop unless you have clear evidence from the transcript that the segment is not a real-world advertisement. Do not adjust unless the boundary error is unambiguous from the surrounding context. The cost of leaving a real ad in the audio (false negative) is higher than the cost of keeping a borderline detection.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No explanation, no markdown.

Each kept ad: {{"is_ad": BOOLEAN_TRUE_ONLY_IF_REAL_AD, "start": FLOAT_SECONDS, "end": FLOAT_SECONDS, "confidence": FLOAT_0_TO_1, "reason": "brief description"}}

Set "is_ad" true only when the span is a real advertisement to cut. Set it false, or return an empty array, when it is not.

ALL values for "start", "end", and "confidence" MUST be numeric (float). Never use strings like "high", "low", "medium", or percentages like "95%". Examples: "start": 45.0, "end": 82.0, "confidence": 0.95

EXAMPLE - KEEP UNCHANGED (boundaries are correct):
Original boundaries: 1245.00s - 1320.50s.
[1240.0s-1245.0s] We will pick that thread back up in a minute.
>>> CANDIDATE AD START [1245.0s] >>>
[1245.0s-1248.0s] This episode is brought to you by BetterHelp.
[1248.0s-1315.0s] BetterHelp is the largest online therapy platform...
[1315.0s-1320.5s] Visit betterhelp.com slash podcast. That's betterhelp.com slash podcast.
<<< CANDIDATE AD END [1320.5s] <<<
[1320.5s-1325.0s] Anyway, back to what we were talking about.

Output: [{{"is_ad": true, "start": 1245.0, "end": 1320.5, "confidence": 0.95, "reason": "Confirmed BetterHelp host-read sponsor with clean boundaries"}}]

EXAMPLE - ADJUST BOUNDARIES (start was late, end was early):
Original boundaries: 100.00s - 130.00s.
[92.0s-95.0s] So that wraps up our discussion. Let's take a quick break.
[95.0s-100.0s] This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens.
>>> CANDIDATE AD START [100.0s] >>>
[100.0s-128.0s] AG1 is the daily foundational nutrition supplement...
[128.0s-130.0s] Go to athleticgreens.com slash podcast.
<<< CANDIDATE AD END [130.0s] <<<
[130.0s-132.0s] That's athleticgreens.com slash podcast.
[132.0s-135.0s] Now, back to our conversation.

Both adjusted timestamps are read straight off context lines: 95.0 starts the line before the marker, 132.0 ends the line after it.

Output: [{{"is_ad": true, "start": 95.0, "end": 132.0, "confidence": 0.92, "reason": "Started at the transition line at 95.0s; ended at 132.0s after the repeated URL"}}]

EXAMPLE - DROP (host mentioning a brand editorially, not an ad):
Original boundaries: 50.00s - 70.00s.
[45.0s-50.0s] Have you been following the Apple antitrust case?
>>> CANDIDATE AD START [50.0s] >>>
[50.0s-62.0s] The DOJ argued that Apple's app store policies harm developers.
[62.0s-70.0s] They want the court to force a change to the commission structure.
<<< CANDIDATE AD END [70.0s] <<<
[70.0s-74.0s] What's your take on the proposed remedies?

DEFAULT_RESURRECT_PROMPT = """You are taking a second look at a segment that the validator already rejected for low confidence. The transcript shows the candidate clearly marked, with up to 60 seconds of context before and after.

Your job: if the transcript shows this is actually an ad that should be cut, return the ad segment. If the validator was right and it is not an ad, return an empty array.

RESURRECT (return one segment): The validator was wrong. The segment is a real-world advertisement and should be cut. Resurrect when:
- The transcript clearly contains promotional language: sponsor name + value proposition + call to action, or polished marketing copy with concentrated brand messaging
- The segment matches the structure of an ad (transition in, sponsor read or platform promo, return to content) even if the validator marked confidence as low
- It is a short brand tagline ad (15-45 seconds) without promo codes, but with concentrated marketing language
- It is a hosting-platform pre/post-roll or cross-promo for another podcast in the network

KEEP REJECTED (return empty array): Agree with the validator. The segment is not a real-world advertisement. Match the same not-an-ad criteria the main reviewer uses:
- A guest discussing their own work in the context of the interview
- Host organically mentioning their own other shows or social media in conversation
- Brand names mentioned in passing as part of editorial topic discussion
- Comedic bits or fictional sponsor reads in the show's creative content
- Silence, pauses, or topic transitions with no promotional transcript content
You may also return [{{"is_ad": false, "reason": "why"}}] instead of an empty array to reject explicitly.

AUDIO CUE SIGNALS: if a labelled audio cue brackets or sits next to the rejected segment, treat it as strong evidence a break happened there; a cue-bracketed segment with even a single sponsor mention is usually a real ad the validator was too cautious about -- resurrect it.

WHEN IN DOUBT: Agree with the validator and return empty. Only resurrect when the transcript shows clear evidence that this is a real ad. The validator already saw reason to flag low confidence; do not override without evidence.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY a valid JSON array. No explanation, no markdown.

Output: [{{"is_ad": true, "start": 666.7, "end": 674.3, "confidence": 0.92, "reason": "Acast hosting platform post-roll, clearly promotional and not editorial"}}]
