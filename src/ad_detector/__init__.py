    #541: a region overlapping ``corroborating_spans`` (markers from other

    (never auto-cut, never dropped) -- real transcript-less DAI ads surface
    for approval, spurious re-encode differentials never silently cut. The
    validator re-derives the hold from ``differential_uncorroborated`` and
    ``_merge_detection_results`` clears it on genuine overlap.

    2.76.0: a region is a candidate only when its measured ``corr`` is a
    number <= measured_corr_max -- a high-corr "differential" mostly matched
    across fetches and is alignment noise; corr None (kind 'unknown') was
    never measured. The gate is PER REGION (the fetcher emits differential
    regions per silence-delimited block); qualifying regions that touch are
    then merged into one candidate span, so a multi-block break jointly
    beats the hold floor while a borderline member neither vetoes the break
    nor rides along. Legacy stored differentials (pre-2.76.0) hard-coded
    corr 0.0 on every differential region, which still qualifies, so recuts
    of old episodes behave as before. Uncorroborated candidates shorter
    than hold_min_seconds (when > 0) are skipped entirely: sub-floor
    differentials are re-roll noise, not fills, and would flood review.
    Corroborated candidates cut regardless of duration.

    2.76.0 cue fusion: ``cue_marks`` are primary-audio template-cue times.
    An uncorroborated merged candidate whose start OR end lies within
    [-AUDIO_CUE_SNAP_LEAD_SECONDS, +AUDIO_CUE_SNAP_LAG_SECONDS] of a cue
    mark (cue at t backs edge e when t - lead <= e <= t + lag) cuts like a
    stage-corroborated candidate -- the show's own ad-break stinger at the
    edge is independent evidence the differential is a real break -- and
    carries ``cue_snap`` so the validator's cue gate (is_cue_backed)
    passes. Like stage corroboration, a cue-backed cut ignores the
    uncorroborated hold floor.
